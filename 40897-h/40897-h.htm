<h2>THE BURGLARS' CLUB:</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A ROMANCE IN TWELVE CHRONICLES.</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIR JOHN CARDER'S CIGARS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Carder</span>, head of the well-known
firm of Carder and Co., merchants, of Manchester,
sat in his warehouse. It was one
o'clock in the morning. Since half-past eight
he had been alone in the building; and
there in his snug private office, before a
cheery fire and beneath electric light, Sir
John prepared to meet what he conceived
to be his fate.</p>

<p>He was insolvent. For some time past
he had suspected that this was the state
of things. Now he was sure of it. The
yearly balance sheet placed in his hand the
previous day by his cashier, together with
sundry figures from his own private ledger,
placed the fact beyond the region of dispute.
Because he felt himself unequal to
the situation, Sir John had shut himself up
in his office&mdash;and on the desk in front of
him was a loaded revolver.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John had strong antiquarian tastes.
His bachelor home in Withington was a
positive museum of curiosities, from Ph&oelig;nician
pottery down to files of English
newspapers when the Georges were kings.
In his office he kept more personal relics of
bygone times, and he was now sorting out
the drawers of a big bureau, full of them.</p>

<p>He had been severely trained in method
by the most orderly of fathers, and had
saved every written communication he had
received since the age of seventeen. It is
therefore quite understandable why his
accumulation of letters was so large, and
partially understandable how he came to
have before him four bulky parcels of them,
respectively endorsed with the names of
Mary, Nell, Kitty, and Flip. The dates of
these, be it at once understood, were not
contemporaneous, though a careful investigator
might have detected a little overlapping.
The letters marked Flip, it ought also to
be stated, came first in point of time.</p>

<p>Sir John lingered long over these bundles,
and read many of the letters. They interested
him greatly, and in their perusal
he almost forgot the evening's ultimate
objective. Connected with these particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
letters was a batch of photographs, on which
he gazed with tender reminiscence. Then
there were other matters of more public
character&mdash;a missive, for instance, from the
Prime Minister, informing him that his
Majesty intended to confer upon him the
honour of knighthood, his Commission in
the Volunteers, and some I.O.U.'s from a
member of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>All these, and many others, Sir John
threw on the desk in front, ready for the
final holocaust. With the feeling of a true
collector he had not the heart to destroy
them singly.</p>

<p>Then, from another drawer, he drew
forth his balance sheets for twenty years,
and glanced them through with almost
as much interest as he had felt for his
letters. Once, it seemed, he had been
worth close on a hundred thousand pounds.
An infatuated belief in a South American
concession, followed by a succession of lean
years in trading, had frittered all this, and
more, away.</p>

<p>While he was gazing gloomily at these
recording figures the door gently opened,
and a man stood on the threshold&mdash;a man
with his coat buttoned tightly up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
neck, with his cap brought down over his
eyes, a man with a lamp&mdash;in short, a burglar.
Sir John stared at him dumbfounded.
Then he glanced at the revolver, but it
was out of reach. The burglar followed his
look, and caught up the weapon.</p>

<p>Now thoroughly aroused, the knight indignantly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You needn't add murder to your other
crimes, my man."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the burglar, "it would
grieve me to have to anticipate your own
intentions."</p>

<p>Sir John was struck, as much by the
melodious voice of the burglar as by his
answer. Nevertheless, in his most magisterial
voice he demanded: "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"Watching an elderly gentleman in an
interesting situation."</p>

<p>"You are impertinent!" flared Sir John.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons. A burglar should,
I believe, be merely brutal."</p>

<p>"May I ask what you expect to find
here?" continued the merchant. "We rarely
keep enough money on the premises to
make it worth your while."</p>

<p>"Postage stamps?" insinuated the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John ignored the suggestion. "Certainly
not enough to make it worth your
while. It may be a matter of penal servitude
for you."</p>

<p>"You open up a wide philosophic question,"
said the burglar suavely. "What is
worth your while in this world? 'Uneasy
is the head that wears a crown.' You seem
worried yourself, Sir John&mdash;going through
your papers at this time o' night, with a
loaded pistol by you."</p>

<p>The merchant was annoyed at the
burglar's perspicacity, and he could not
think of an effective rejoinder. His visitor
advanced to the bureau. The photographs
immediately engaged his attention. "Ha!"
he exclaimed approvingly. "But it really
isn't fair. One, two, three, four. Greedy
man!"</p>

<p>"Will you kindly leave my private
matters alone?" said the incensed knight.
Then, with a sudden inspiration, he made a
reckless dash for freedom by grabbing at
the telephone handle, turning briskly, and
shouting down the receiver, "Help! Thieves!
Help!" But before he had called again
the burglar had raised his revolver and had
severed the connecting wire with a shot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
"What an absurd idea," he said. "Why,
the operator isn't awake yet."</p>

<p>Sir John sank back into his chair, feeling
it was very likely that the burglar
would adopt some extremely unpleasant
form of revenge for the want of confidence
he had just displayed. But his visitor did
nothing of the sort. He also seated himself,
and addressed the knight in grave
reproof.</p>

<p>"If that's a sample of your best business
method I'm surprised you've done so well
in things," he said. Then without waiting
for a reply, "Where do you keep your
cigars?"</p>

<p>The merchant stretched out his hand and
passed a box to him. The burglar rolled
one knowingly between his fingers, then
replaced it, and gave the box back.</p>

<p>"I don't care for tenpenny whiffs, Sir
John. I want your real cigars&mdash;such as
you keep for your most eminent visitors&mdash;such
as you should have offered me, as a
matter of course."</p>

<p>With a sigh Sir John rose, unlocked
a cabinet, and produced a box marked
"<span class="smcap">Topmann. Sublimes. Habana</span>," which
he handed to his visitor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The burglar examined it carefully before
he expressed his satisfaction. Then he took
a cigar therefrom, inspected it with marked
approval, lit it, and then dropped the box
into a capacious pocket.</p>

<p>"Those are exceptionally fine cigars,"
the knight remarked, with a touch of resentment
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I know it. I've come all the way from
town to fetch 'em," the burglar answered.</p>

<p>Sir John was surprised. "It's a long
way and a dangerous mission for such an
object."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said the burglar, with provoking
complacency.</p>

<p>"And may I ask how you come to know
of them?" asked Sir John, whose curiosity
was aroused.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you, since I've
got them safe. You opened this box for
a particular guest at the Chamber of Commerce
dinner a month ago."</p>

<p>"Lord Ribston?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he spoke about them at the
Burglars' Club. It was my turn, and here
I am&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>"The Burglars' Club!" exclaimed Sir
John, in much surprise. "I've never heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of such an institution. And pray what has
Lord Ribston, an ex-Cabinet Minister, to do
with it?"</p>

<p>"He's one of us," the burglar explained.
"You see, we are men who've pretty well
exhausted the pleasures of life. We've all
been in the Army or the Navy, all of us
are sportsmen, and we are bachelors; so
there isn't much excitement left for us.
We've started a Burglars' Club to help
things on a bit. The entrance fee is a town
burglary, the subject to be set by our President,
and every other year each member
has to keep up his subscription by a provincial
line. 'Sir John Carder's prime cigars
by Wednesday,' was the item fixed for me
at our club meeting last week, and I've got
'em easy," said the burglar, with much
professional complacency.</p>

<p>"You astonish me," Sir John said. "In
fact, I've never heard a more amazing thing
in my life. But isn't it rather risky, telling
me all this?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. No one would believe you
if you split on us, and you wouldn't find
our club if you wanted to. But you wouldn't
split. A man who smokes Topmann's Sublimes
couldn't do such a thing if he tried."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John acknowledged this speech with
a bow. "But I'm greatly surprised Lord
Ribston should belong to such a club," he
said. "No offence to you intended," he
added hastily, feeling that his remark was
hardly polite.</p>

<p>"And no offence taken," said the burglar
magnanimously. "Do you know, Sir John,
there are a good many things going on in
town that would be likely to astonish you
a great deal more than this little club of
ours if you only knew of 'em?" Then,
after a moment's pause, "As you've helped
me so nicely in this cigar business I shall
be delighted to do you a good turn. Can
I be of any use to you?"</p>

<p>In saying this the burglar's eyes travelled
involuntarily to the pile of papers on the
desk. Sir John's did the same, and he
sighed.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied in an outburst of
confidence that astonished himself, "I'm in
a hole."</p>

<p>"I thought as much," said the other.
"I've been in a good many myself in my
time, so perhaps I can help you to get
out."</p>

<p>The knight shook his head gloomily. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
don't think so. There's nothing for it but
a bullet."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed the burglar.
He plunged his hand into his pocket, and
produced the box of cigars. "Try one of
these," he said, offering them to Sir John.
"I can recommend 'em for big occasions."</p>

<p>The merchant smiled sadly, but took
the consolation offered. "You see," he
explained, "it's my pay-day to-morrow.
There's nine thousand pounds in cash
wanted, and I've nothing towards it."</p>

<p>"Beastly awkward," said the burglar
sympathetically. "I know what it feels
like. Tell 'em to call again."</p>

<p>"I can't. If I don't pay I must file
my petition."</p>

<p>"File your banker!" exclaimed the
other. "Don't you do anything rash.
There's many a man lived to regret ever
dreaming of insolvency. I suppose you've
realised all your assets?"</p>

<p>"Every one," said Sir John, "except
things like these," and he pulled out the
I.O.U.'s from the pile of papers.</p>

<p>The burglar looked at them. "Well?"
he said inquiringly. "You've had these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
three years. Why the blazes haven't you
got your money?"</p>

<p>"The Marquis of Chillingford hasn't got
any money," replied the knight sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I know he hasn't to-day, but he had
yesterday, and he may have to-morrow.
Why, man, he scooped in a cool ten thou'
when Tadpole won the Derby."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Sir John.</p>

<p>"But I do. If you will lend money to
lords, why the blazes don't you take in the
sporting papers, and keep an eye on your
friends? Tommy Chillingford is far too
busy a man to remember these bits of
paper, but I'm sure nothing would have
pleased him more than to have paid you
back your money if you'd suggested it at
the time. He's had a run of confounded
bad luck since then, but he'll bob up
serenely one of these days, and you take
my tip and get in that time. What else
have you in this line?"</p>

<p>The knight opened a drawer, and therefrom
produced a bundle of promissory notes
and dishonoured cheques.</p>

<p>"What a philanthropist you've been in
your day!" said the burglar admiringly, as
he examined them. "I wish I'd known you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
earlier. Ah!" and he pulled out a draft.
"What's wrong with this?"</p>

<p>"That's another impecunious peer," said
Sir John. "He proposed me for the
Carlton," he added apologetically.</p>

<p>"Then may I be impecunious," replied
the burglar. "Dicky is a millionaire in
South America."</p>

<p>"I've not come across his name in that
light," said the merchant dubiously.</p>

<p>"He's changed it. Calls himself Thompson
now. This thing is worth its face value,
and that's two thousand pounds. Why, man,
you must tender it at once for payment."</p>

<p>For a moment the knight's face brightened.</p>

<p>"But wait a bit," continued the burglar.
"There's a six-years' limit for presentation,
isn't there? This was due March 12th,
1897, and it's now&mdash;oh, Great Scott!&mdash;it's
now March 18th, 1903! Too late by a week!
Old man, you are unlucky! Two thousand
solid sovereigns missed by a week, and you
wantin' 'em all the time. It's beastly hard
lines. Do have a light."</p>

<p>But Sir John was too limp to smoke.
"A millionaire in South America!" he
gasped. "Why, he went out at my request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to see if a concession I have there was worth
anything. He reported adversely, and I've
heard nothing about him since then."</p>

<p>"What is your concession?"</p>

<p>From the pile in front the knight found
an imposing-looking parchment, decorated
with the signature of a President and the
seal of a State. He handed it to the burglar,
who read it through carefully. Then he
laid it down.</p>

<p>"Sir John Carder," he said gravely, as
a judge addressing a prisoner, "you are an
unmitigated donkey. You must forgive the
insult, but really the provocation is simply
awful. I've lived in the Argentine, and if
this concession of yours isn't the very one
Mr. Thompson is now working for his own
benefit I'm a double-dyed Dutchman."</p>

<p>Sir John gazed at him open-eyed. "I
can't believe you," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't, if it hurts you," the burglar
replied; "but I'll make a proposal, to
show you I have no doubts about it myself.
If you'll have me as equal partner with you
in this concession matter, and leave me to
manage it my own way, I'll take over your
pay-day to-morrow, and be jolly well pleased
with the bargain."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll meet my payments to-morrow!"
gasped Sir John, who for some little time
had been wondering whether he were awake
or asleep, or in a post-mortem delirium consequent
on a revolver shot. "You'll meet
my payments!"</p>

<p>Once more the burglar pulled out the
cigar box. "Do have another," he said
persuasively.</p>

<p>Sir John took one mechanically, but after
trying in vain to light it he put it down.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dicky Thompson," soliloquised the
burglar, "this explains a good deal. We all
marvelled at your luck, for we knew you
didn't deserve it. You once sold me a
spavined mare. If this isn't retribution I
don't know what is. Now, Carder, let's
get to bed. You must give me a shakedown
somewhere. We've to be very spry
and early to-morrow. There's our partnership
to fix up first thing, and I've to show
these cigars at the Burglars' Club in the
evening, and on Saturday I sail for South
America with this precious document and
a sharp legal practitioner. And I'll take
your revolver with me in case the lawyer
gets hoarse. Oh, I was forgetting. A telegram
form, please. Where do you bank?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
County and City. Right. It's nine thousand
you want, isn't it? Right again." The
burglar filled up the form, counted his words,
took the necessary stamps from his pocket
book, and affixed them. "Now, we'll just
drop this in the first pillar-box we meet,
and by the time we've signed our partnership
there'll be enough at the County and City
to meet your payments."</p>

<p>Sir John looked at him admiringly. "Are
there many as smart as you at the Burglars'
Club?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Smarter," said the burglar modestly.
"I'm about the clumsiest of the lot. Some
day I'll tell you how Ribston stole the Bishop
of Bister's crozier, and then you'll know
why he is generally all there in the House.
But come along now. All right; you close
up and put the lights out. I'll take a short
cut, and be waiting outside."</p>

<p>It was fully five minutes before Sir John
had locked up his papers and had put on
his coat. As he emerged from his warehouse
door he was promptly collared by a policeman,
while another seized him firmly from
behind. A third was in possession of the
handcuffed burglar, and an inspector stood
by with a box of cigars under his arm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pore old pard!" said the burglar, with
ostentatious sympathy. "They've nabbed
us both at larst."</p>

<p>"Now come along quietly, will you?"
said the first policeman to the struggling
knight.</p>

<p>"Leave go!" shouted his indignant
charge. "I'm Sir John Carder."</p>

<p>The policeman laughed derisively, but
something in the voice made the inspector
flash his light on him.</p>

<p>"Sir John it is," he gasped.</p>

<p>The policemen released their hold, and
gazed ruefully at their late prisoner.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this, Markham?"
demanded Sir John.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, sir. Hope you'll overlook
it. We caught this chap red-handed, and
he said he was working the job with a pal
who was tidying things up a bit."</p>

<p>"Well, he was quite right. He is a friend
of mine."</p>

<p>The inspector was more astonished than
ever. "He came through one of the packing-room
windows, Sir John," he expostulated,
"and he had a boxful of cigars in his
pocket."</p>

<p>"Not full, inspector," said the burglar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sadly. "I told you my friend would explain
matters, but you wouldn't listen."</p>

<p>"Release him," said Sir John.</p>

<p>The inspector unlocked the handcuffs,
saluted stiffly, turned his men round, and
was marching off with them, when the
burglar called out, "My cigars, please."</p>

<p>The inspector came back, handed the
box over, saluted even more stiffly than
before, and retired.</p>

<p>Sir John and the burglar watched the
retreating escort out of sight.</p>

<p>"It's been a narrow squeak for both of
us to-night," said the burglar reflectively.</p>

<p>"It has," replied Sir John.</p>

<p>Then they turned the corner together.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BISHOP OF BISTER'S CROZIER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bishop of Bister's dinner hour was eight
o'clock. With unfailing regularity, when at
the palace, he entered the drawing-room at
7.58 in order to collect his family and any
guests. His annoyance may therefore be
understood when at 7.55 on the night in
question a servant brought him a card on
which was written:</p>

<p>"Georgiowitch Kassala, Mush, L. Van,
Khurd., craves audience."</p>

<p>"The gentleman is in the examination
room, my lord," the servant added.</p>

<p>"A very awkward time for calling,"
said the Bishop, consulting his watch unnecessarily.
Then, with a sigh, "Ask your
mistress to keep dinner back ten minutes."</p>

<p>His lordship ambled to the examination
room. A big man in a loose blue cassock-like
garb rose at his entrance&mdash;a big-limbed,
red-bearded man, with enormous eyebrows.
He rose, bowed low, and sank on his knees,
caught hold of the prelate's hand, caressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
it gently, and finally kissed it. The Bishop
was embarrassed. He preferred that sort of
thing to be done before an audience, when
he would play his part with the best of them,
but with no spectators at all he felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Rise," he said gently.</p>

<p>The red-bearded man obeyed. "I
am&mdash;" he began. "I have come&mdash;ah, perhaps
I had better show you my papers. I
have a letter from my Patriarch." This
in excellent English, with just a trace of
a foreign accent.</p>

<p>From his capacious pocket he drew out
a bundle of papers. He abstracted a letter
therefrom, and handed it with evident pride
to the Bishop.</p>

<p>It was apparently Greek, yet it was not
the language his lordship of Bister had learnt
at school and college. Here and there he
saw a word he almost knew, yet the next
one to it was a perfect stranger. He glanced
at the end. There was a big seal, an extraordinary
date, an impossible name.</p>

<p>His visitor seemed to appreciate the
position. "Our Patriarch is old," he said.
"He is no longer facile to read. I sometimes
have difficulty myself, though I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his writing well. May I read it to
you?"</p>

<p>He did this with great fluency and
emphasis; but the Bishop understood
nothing, though occasionally he thought he
caught the sound of a fleeting particle.</p>

<p>The letter was finished. "And this," said
the reader, producing a blue document, "is
more earthy." It was, being from Scotland
Yard, informing all and sundry that the
bearer, Georgiowitch Kassala, a Christian
priest, was authorised to collect subscriptions
for the church of Saint Barnabas at Mush,
in Khurdistan.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Bishop, with perhaps a
shade of disappointment in his voice. "I
hope you have been successful."</p>

<p>"Your Grace, I have travelled far, and
not without recompense. To all I have said,
'If you give me money it is well, but if you
do not it is still well.' Some have replied,
'Then we'll leave it at that,' but many
have responded. See&mdash;here is my subscription
book. I have begged from Batoum
to Bister. I have received money in fifteen
different coinages, of which the English is
the finest and difficultest. Perhaps my most
interesting contribution is this&mdash;see, a kopeck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from Lassitudino Hospidar, the heathen cook
of a Bulgarian wind-jammer, in memory of
his maternal uncle, who died from the bite
of a mad dog at Varna. And now, being
in Bister, I thought, although it is late, I
will at once call upon his Grace the Bishop,
whose fame has reached our little town of
Mush, whose name is known by the deep
waters of Van."</p>

<p>His lordship sighed. The west end of his
cathedral was sinking below the surface.
At the present rate of subsidence the Dean
had calculated that only the gargoyles would
be above ground in the year 3000. This
had to be stopped. There was a matter of
underpinning for a start, but it costs money
to underpin the west end of a cathedral.
And all the while the usual subscription
lists had to be headed from the Palace, and
there was more than the usual depression
in agriculture. The Bishop felt that it was
a singularly inappropriate moment to contribute
to a church in Khurdistan, yet it
would not do to discount his own fair fame
in that far distant land. He must think
the matter over. Meantime he would offer
his guest such hospitality as would compensate
for the smallness of his contribution.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "your Patriarch
shall not appeal to me in vain, although, as
you may well believe, I have many calls
upon my purse. But we will speak again of
this. You will, of course, spend the night
under my roof, and now, if you will join us
at dinner I shall be very pleased."</p>

<p>The priest's face broke into smiles. "You
are most kind," he replied. "I shall be
glad." Then he glanced doubtfully from the
Bishop's evening dress to his own raiment.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said his lordship pleasantly.
"'A wash and a brush up,' as our saying is,
and you'll be all right. Come along."</p>

<p>It was 8.15 when they entered the drawing-room.
"My dear," said the Bishop appeasingly
to his hungry wife, "I have brought a
visitor from Mush, in Asia Minor. Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Kassala&mdash;Mrs.
Dacre&mdash;my daughters."</p>

<p>The visitor bowed low before the ladies.
The Bishop thought he was going to kneel,
so restrained him with a gentle hand. "Here,"
he went on, "is my chaplain, Mr. Jones,
who will be greatly interested to hear of
your work at home. And this," he concluded,
"is our friend, Mr. Marmaduke
Percy."</p>

<p>Then they moved to the dining-room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>At dinner Mr. Kassala conducted himself
with ease, and spoke with great fluency on
many matters; so much so that Mr. Marmaduke
Percy, no doubt feeling that the Asiatic
was monopolizing too much attention, asked
him somewhat abruptly where he had
acquired his excellent English.</p>

<p>"I had it from one of your countrymen,
sir," replied Mr. Kassala pleasantly. "He
was engaged in the smuggling of aniline
dyes into Persia. Of course, I did not know
his real occupation, or I should have had
nothing to do with him. He pretended to
import chocolates and acid drops and&mdash;barley-sugar,
I think he called it&mdash;and such-like
things; but they were all filled with
aniline colours. In return for language
lessons he got me to introduce him to the
chief of the Persian frontier Customs, whom
he bribed for his purposes. He made a
large fortune before the Shah discovered
that the colours of the Palace carpets were
fading. My friend, the chief of the frontier
Customs, was beheaded, and three dyers
were put into plaster of Paris; but the
Englishman escaped. His name was Benjamin
Watts. Do you happen to know
him, sir?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The episcopal circle was justly shocked
at this recital of their countryman's perfidy,
and Mr. Percy warmly repudiated any knowledge
of Mr. Watts.</p>

<p>The Bishop found his guest profoundly
interesting, and he twice made notes in his
pocket-book about Asiatic matters. The
ladies left the room regretfully.</p>

<p>The chaplain, who was of an extremely
bashful temperament, now put a question
that had been trembling on his tongue all
the dinner hour.</p>

<p>"Is not your village somewhere near
Mount Ararat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. We can see its snow-capped
summit quite plainly from Mush. With a
telescope we can even discern where the
Ark rested after the Flood."</p>

<p>The Bishop looked at his guest reprovingly,
for jokes on such matters grieved him deeply.</p>

<p>"I mean it, your Grace," said Kassala.
"Surely you heard that the Ark itself was
discovered about three months ago?"</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed the Bishop and the
chaplain together. "The Ark discovered?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Kassala replied. "My
venerable Patriarch had long suspected
that remnants might be found preserved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the perpetual ice, so he sought the assistance
of Professor Papineau, of Prague, who was
travelling in the East. After months of&mdash;what
do you call it?&mdash;pro&mdash;yes&mdash;prospecting&mdash;this
gentleman discovered an enormous
chunk of ice bearing some resemblance in
outline to the object of their search. The
only possible way to remove the ice was by
blasting, and Professor Papineau inserted a
charge of dynamite. A fatal mistake was
made in the size of the charge, with the
result that the whole enormous chunk was
blown to atoms. Embedded in the fragments
were found what were apparently portions
of a leviathan ship, which my Patriarch
and Professor Papineau regard as being the
veritable vessel built by Noah. In no other
way but by a universal deluge could it have
got on Mount Ararat. But for the mistake
made in the size of the charge the structure
of the Ark might have been at any rate
partially preserved. It was a terrible misfortune,
only to be compared to the destruction
of the Parthenon by the Venetians.
Professor Papineau was for a long fortnight
ill in bed with remorse. He reads a paper
on the whole incident at the forthcoming
Oriental Congress at Prague.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"But perhaps I have been indiscreet.
Evidently the news has not reached your
country, and the Professor may wish to be
the first to give it to the world. He might
resent my telling you, and my Patriarch
would be grieved. I beg you to keep the
information inviolate until you read of Professor
Papineau's paper at Prague."</p>

<img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="500" height="365" alt="Man in robes and skullcap standing, looking at crozier in front of a man seated at a table and another man standing" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MR. KASSALA HAD THEN THE PLEASURE OF INSPECTING THE CROZIER.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_27">p. 27.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The Bishop and the chaplain nodded their
assent. They seemed to have no words left
in them. After breathing-space they both
pulled out their pocket-books, and made
some memoranda.</p>

<p>Later the conversation turned on vestments,
and such matters. "Do you know,
your Grace," said Mr. Kassala, "I have
heard that you are the only bishop with
a pastoral staff. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"No. It's the other way about. I'm
the only bishop who hasn't one. I alone
share with the archbishops the dignity of a
crozier. The old crozier of the see is now
kept in our chapter house. It was too old
for use, so last year the ladies of the county
presented me with a new one. If you like,
I will show it you. Mr. Jones, I wonder if
you would mind bringing my crozier from
the library?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Five minutes later the chaplain re-appeared,
bringing a long case with him. This
was duly opened, and Mr. Kassala had then
the pleasure of inspecting the crozier presented
by the ladies of the county. It was
of ebony and gold, and was richly jewelled.
It was a work of art well worth the encomiums
bestowed upon it by the Asiatic.</p>

<p>"With your permission, your Grace," he
said, "I should very much like to make a
water-colour sketch of it in order to show
to my Patriarch, who is deeply interested
in such matters. He has a very fine crozier
himself. Would you allow me?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I will do it before breakfast
in the morning. I am an early riser.
I suppose I may find it in this room?"</p>

<p>The Bishop nodded, but Mr. Percy intervened.
"Allow me to take care of it over-night,
Bishop. I don't think you ought to
leave such a valuable article about. There
is always the possibility of burglars. I am
told there is a gang in the district just now."</p>

<p>The Bishop smiled good-humouredly. "I
don't think we need consider that eventuality,"
he said. "But as you like. Now
shall we join the ladies?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Kassala was hardly as entertaining
in the drawing-room as he had
previously been. He seemed a little preoccupied.
At eleven the house party retired
to rest, Mr. Percy carefully carrying to his
room the case containing the crozier.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="398" height="500" alt="Man in nightshirt watching another man in nightshirt climb out of a window" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE SAW THE FIGURE PASS A WINDOW.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_28">p. 28.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The Reverend Arthur Jones, his lordship's
chaplain, was a light sleeper at best, and to-night
the excitement of Mr. Kassala's visit
kept him particularly wide-awake. His
thoughts were with the unhappy Professor
Papineau. He was wondering whether it
would not be kind to send him a letter of
sympathy, when his attention was attracted
by a noise outside his room. He jumped
out of bed and opened his door quietly.
Someone was stealthily walking along the
corridor. He saw the figure pass a window,
and the moonlight fell upon Mr. Kassala.
In great wonderment Mr. Jones followed.
A turn of the passage brought the Asiatic
to the head of the great staircase, and here
he stopped so suddenly that the chaplain
almost ran into him. For two minutes
Mr. Kassala paused in a state of indecision.
Then he advanced to a door, and gently
opened it. Mr. Jones was paralysed with
horror. It was the Bishop's bedroom. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
could Mr. Kassala want there? Determined
to save his beloved chief, Mr. Jones followed.
As he entered the room there was an exclamation
from the Bishop. Mr. Jones turned
involuntarily. As he did so, Mr. Kassala
collided with him. The Bishop sprang out
of bed, and switched on the electric light.
"Mr. Kassala!" he exclaimed. "And Mr.
Jones! Pray, what is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, your Grace," said
the Asiatic. "I have mistaken the room.
I wanted Mr. Percy."</p>

<p>At this moment the next door opened,
and Mr. Percy appeared.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's what I should like to know,"
said the prelate. "Mr. Kassala says he is
looking for you."</p>

<p>"Indeed! What for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;was wondering if you had a
camel-hair paint brush?" said Mr. Kassala.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't wonder any longer.
I haven't," Mr. Percy replied.</p>

<p>"And what do you want, Mr. Jones?"
asked the Bishop sternly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my lord, nothing," said the
unhappy Jones. "I was only following Mr.
Kassala."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then perhaps you'll follow him to
bed," remarked the Bishop drily. "I hope
I shall have a more satisfactory explanation
in the morning."</p>

<p>Here, no doubt feeling that the situation
was hardly in keeping with his dignity, the
Bishop closed his door. Mr. Percy did the
same, while Mr. Kassala and the shivering
Jones returned to their corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. Kassala seemed rather amused than
otherwise at the situation, but Mr. Jones
was permeated with distress. "Cheer up,"
said the Asiatic, as he turned into his room.
"If you will meddle in other people's business
you're bound to suffer for it."</p>

<p>There was no sleep for the unhappy
chaplain that night. He was in love with
the eldest Miss Dacre, who, he had reason to
believe, returned his affection, and he had
determined to see her father on the subject
on the morrow. But after the events of
that night such an interview was highly
inadvisable. Yet he had acted from the
best and most creditable of motives. Only
by hearsay was he acquainted with the
habits and customs of the East, but he felt
sure that honest Asiatics would not be found
prowling about a palace in the midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hours. What did Mr. Kassala want in the
Bishop's room? Was it theft or&mdash;something
worse? Was this self-styled priest the
emissary of some Eastern organization bent
upon destroying the flower of the Western
hierarchy? Was he a Thug? Mr. Jones
shuddered at the possibilities of the situation.</p>

<p>Ha! What was that? Again a creak
outside. For a moment he listened breathlessly.
Then he opened his door again.
Good gracious! there was Mr. Kassala once
more slinking down the corridor.</p>

<p>Hastily putting on his dressing-gown,
Mr. Jones followed, with nerves strung to
their highest tension. This time the Asiatic
walked with no uncertain step. As he passed
the Bishop's door the chaplain's heart gave
a bound of relief. He stopped at Mr. Percy's
door, and tapped gently. The light in the
room was turned on, and the door opened
by Mr. Percy himself. Mr. Kassala entered,
and the door closed noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>For some minutes Mr. Jones stared at
the door in blank amazement. Then he
turned round, and walked slowly back to
his own room. In times of great perplexity
he was accustomed to look for guidance
to Mr. Paley's "Evidences." Mechanically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he now took down the well-thumbed volume
from its shelf, and opened it. He sat for
many hours staring at the print without
ever turning the page.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Kassala?" were the
Bishop's first words on entering the breakfast-room
the next morning. Although his lordship
had betrayed no consciousness of his
existence Mr. Jones felt that the inquiry
was levelled at him.</p>

<p>"I do not know, my lord," he answered.</p>

<p>"John," said the Bishop to his butler,
"will you inform Mr. Kassala that breakfast
is on the table?"</p>

<p>In a few minutes John returned with the
information that Mr. Kassala's room was
empty, that his bed had not been slept in,
and that nobody had seen him that morning.</p>

<p>"This is very singular," said his lordship.
Then, after a pause, "One hardly
likes to say so, but I must confess my confidence
in the <i>bona fides</i> of Mr. Kassala has
been shaken. You spoke about burglars last
night, Marmaduke, in reference to my crozier,
which seemed to have a peculiar attraction
for Mr. Kassala. I hope it is safe."</p>

<p>"I put the case on the top of my wardrobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
last night, and it was there five minutes
ago," said Mr. Percy.</p>

<p>"I wonder what his object could be in
coming here, and then leaving us in this
extraordinary manner. Perhaps you can
throw some light on that very peculiar incident
in the middle of the night, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"I heard a noise, my lord, and followed
Mr. Kassala to see what he was doing. I
haven't the faintest idea why he went into
your room, unless it really was, as he said,
that he had mistaken it for Mr. Percy's."</p>

<p>"But what should he want with Mr.
Percy?" asked Mrs. Dacre.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Percy will answer that?"
said the chaplain, with much meaning in
his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy fixed the eyeglass and looked
coolly at the chaplain. "How on earth
should I know, Jones?" he said. With
this oracular remark he returned to his egg.</p>

<p>The chaplain was bursting with indignation
at Mr. Percy's concealment of his midnight
interview with Mr. Kassala. He longed
to expose him, but shrank from the necessity
of a painful scene.</p>

<p>"Mildred," said Mrs. Dacre suddenly,
"let us look through the drawing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
silver at once. I hope the equestrian statuette
of your father is safe."</p>

<p>While the ladies were ticking off their
household gods, Mr. Percy went to his room
to pack, and Mr. Jones followed.</p>

<p>"May I have his lordship's crozier?"
asked the chaplain.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Here you are. But you do
look unhappy, Jones! Whatever is the
matter?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jones took the case without replying.
"The key was in the lock last night," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Was it? Then it must have dropped
out somewhere. Perhaps it's on the floor."
But it did not seem to be there, although
both Mr. Percy and the chaplain looked very
carefully for it.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the former, after five
minutes' fruitless search. "It will probably
turn up after I've gone. Remember, that
I'll be responsible for any damage."</p>

<p>The chaplain was very pale. "Mr.
Percy," he said, "I know of your midnight
interview with Mr. Kassala."</p>

<p>Once more Mr. Percy fixed his monocle.
"Do you, old man?" he replied. "Then
I won't be the one to get you into trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
over it. You may rely on me. If you don't
say anything, I shan't. Now good-bye. It'll
take me all my time to get my things together.
My man's ill, and I'm out of
practice."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones left the room more bewildered
than ever. His lordship, after leaving
stringent instructions regarding Mr. Kassala,
should he again appear, went by the noon
train to town with Mr. Percy.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones appeared singularly distracted
that day, and Miss Dacre gazed at him with
much concern. He spent the evening alone
with Paley, and about eleven o'clock, with
firm determination on his face, he forced
the lock of the crozier case. His worst fears
were realised. In place of the crozier of
ebony, gold, and jewels, the present of the
ladies of the county, there reposed in the
purple velvet lining a common bedroom poker!</p>

<p>At that very moment the Bishop of
Bister's crozier lay on the table of a London
mansion. Twelve men were gathered round
it, complimenting their host upon it. Their
host, by the way, was lately his Majesty's
Secretary of State for Egypt. He was now
attired in a long blue cassock-like garb,
such as Asiatic priests may wear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the burglary of the Bishop of
Bister's crozier Lord Ribston's subscription
has been paid for the next two years," said
one of the men, making a cypher note in
a book.</p>

<p>"Hear, hear! Bravo! Good for the
Ribston Pippin!" was the general chorus.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the man in the
priestly garb, rising to his feet amidst applause,
"I am proud once more to have
been able to fulfil the mandate of our Club.
With your permission, I will now pack up
the bauble so that it may be returned by
the midnight express in order to ease the
mind of a most worthy man, his lordship's
chaplain. But before I do so I wish to
propose a new member&mdash;Mr. Marmaduke
Percy. You will recollect that his name was
brought forward twelve months or so ago,
but he was not considered equal to the
demands that are occasionally made upon
the members of this honourable fraternity.
I have reason to believe that we did Mr.
Percy an injustice. Yesterday, at any rate,
he saw through my disguise, and divined
my purpose. He could easily have betrayed
me. But he behaved in a sportsmanlike
way, and for that reason I now propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that he should become one of us. Major
Armytage is seconding. You will have an
opportunity of voting for Mr. Percy at our
next meeting. Is there any further business
before us, Mr. Secretary?"</p>

<p>The Secretary consulted his book. "I
note that Mr. Danby Travers' subscription
is due," he said.</p>

<p>"Good old Danby! Pile it on! Make
it thick enough!" was the varied cry.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Secretary, "we
meet on Tuesday next, and Mr. Danby
Travers will then be asked for the Black
Pearl of Agni, the property of the Illingworths."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LUCK OF THE ILLINGWORTHS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Danby Travers</span> was annoyed. He was one
of the founders of the Burglars' Club. His
entrance fee had been the temporary abstraction
from the Crown Jewels of the Koh-i-noor
itself. Two years ago he had kept up his
membership by the burglary of the Duchess
of Guiseley's emeralds; and now, by the unkindness
of Fate or the simple cussedness
of his committee, he could only renew his
subscription by purloining the Black Pearl
of Agni. It showed the folly of becoming
the champion jewel burglar of the club.</p>

<p>Of course it was pure coincidence, for
only four people knew that he was in love
with Mary Illingworth. Mary knew it, because
he had told her; Lord and Lady
Illingworth, because they had been fatuously
consulted in the matter; and he, Danby
Travers, because of a stuffy, despairing
feeling somewhere in his chest from the
moment of awakening in the morning down
to the last gleam of consciousness at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
But the Burglars' Club did not know it,
nor did they know that Lord Illingworth
had told him that in future he was not to
cross the baronial threshold; and all because,
despite his brilliant record in India
and at Hurlingham, he, Danby Travers,
was as poor as a chapel mouse.</p>

<p>Therefore he received the mandate of the
club with something less than his usual
urbanity. But reflection brought a Mephistophelean
suggestion of comfort. He had
been unable to rob Lord Illingworth of his
fairest daughter. He would at any rate
purloin his most valued jewel.</p>

<p>The Black Pearl of Agni was world-renowned.
During the military operations
in the Western Deccan in 1803 it had been
looted by a certain Major Illingworth, of
the Bengal Native Infantry, from a rich
temple dedicated to the Hindoo God of Fire.
From that day his fortunes had prospered
amazingly. Promotion came for the asking;
wealth by marriage and bequest. Influence,
social and political, had followed, and a
title. Succeeding generations had added to
the score. Two descendants of the sepoy
major had attained Cabinet rank, and the
present peer had won the Derby. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Luck of the Illingworths had become
proverbial.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="361" height="500" alt="woman seated at a table before an idol; man leaning toward her" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. HAD SHOWN HIM THE SECRET OF ITS HIDING-PLACE.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_40">p. 40.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The jewel was kept at Knowlesworth.
Travers knew the place well. He had spent
a fortnight there, and there he had made
love to Mary Illingworth. She had shown
him the Pearl; and, because he was to be
her husband, had shown him the secret of
its hiding-place. Little did he think at the
time that the next occasion on which he
entered that room would be as a burglar&mdash;an
amateur one, it is true, but still a
burglar.</p>

<p>No wonder that Danby Travers was
annoyed. The only justification for his conduct
that he could think of was that the
temporary loss of the Pearl would probably
have a beneficial effect on Lord Illingworth's
character.</p>

<p>He had received the secretary's intimation
on the Friday morning. He had to
show the Pearl at the next meeting of
the club&mdash;on the following Tuesday night.
That gave him four days for the business.</p>

<p>Knowlesworth was sure to be full of
visitors, for Lord Illingworth had succeeded
a late Master of Balliol in entertaining the
most distinguished week-end parties in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
country. Travers turned to the <i>Post</i>, certain
to find the list. Ah! here it was:</p>

<p>"Lord and Lady Illingworth are having
a large party at Knowlesworth, entertaining
the Bohemian Ambassador and Countess
Polsky, the Duke of Strathpeffer, the Marquess
and Marchioness of Bridlington, the
Dean of Penzance, Professor Rawson, and
others."</p>

<p>"What a crew!" thought Travers.
"Wouldn't Strathpeffer be pleased if I came
a cropper! I wonder he can go there after
Mary's last refusal. I'll wait till they thin
a bit. Some are sure to go on Monday,
so Monday night is my best time for the
job. Now for Bradshaw."</p>

<p>On the following Monday night, Travers
took a second-class ticket at Charing Cross
in order to minimise the chance of running
against friends. From sheer curiosity he
chose a compartment in which two singular-looking
men were already seated. The
weather was by no means cold, yet they were
swathed in winter clothing. Thick mufflers
were round their necks. Their faces were
partly hidden by the wraps, and partly
shaded by the broad brims of silk hats
built about the time of the Crimean War.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But their race was unmistakable&mdash;to Travers
at least. They were Hindoos&mdash;the tall one
probably a man of caste, the podgy person
possibly a Baboo.</p>

<p>In his interest at coming across these
strange people Travers forgot his ultimate
objective. He settled himself in his corner,
prepared either to join in conversation with,
or merely to watch, his quaint fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>On his entrance they had turned their
eyes upon him, but they had resumed their
conversation. As the train got on its way
they raised their voices, and, confident of
not being understood, they spoke with
absolute unrestraint. Travers, with knowledge
derived from ten years' service in the
Madras and Indian Staff Corps, was easily
able to follow their talk.</p>

<p>"At last," said the tall man, as the train
moved out of the station.</p>

<p>"At last," repeated the other. "Buck
up. Now is the conclusion of your spacious
quest."</p>

<p>"Say rather the beginning. So far it
has been easy, despite the horror of mingling
with these barbarians. To lose caste was
foreseen, but now we enter upon the unknown."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I take the liberty of
emphasising the necessity of bucking up.
To-morrow you will be a thrice happy man,
and I will weave a garland of marigolds for
your honourable head. Gosh!" This as
the train entered a tunnel with a hideous
shriek. "It is a taste of the underworld,"
he added.</p>

<p>The tall man shuddered, and remained
silent. As the train emerged his companion
gave a very creditable imitation of the
whistle and the tunnel.</p>

<p>The tall man smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"Ramma Lal," he said, "I envy you
your merry disposition. It was in a good
moment that I met thee in Bombay,
<i>baboo-jee</i>. You have served me well in
guiding me hither, and in enlivening me
on the long journey."</p>

<p>"Your honour is pleased to be excessively
gracious," said the Baboo with absurd complacency.
"Indeed, my tip-top spirits have
been of much service to myself and many
other honourable gentlemen, and have been
extraordinarily admired by English ladies."
He pulled out his watch. "In the space
of half an hour we shall have arrived at our
long-intended destination."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"So soon? Show me the plan again to
refresh my memory."</p>

<p>The Baboo produced a piece of paper,
over which they bent their heads.</p>

<p>"Here is the railway station at which
we shall dismount. This pink streak is the
highway-road along which we shall travel,
eventually reaching the big brass gates
belonging to ancestral home. A little beyond
is a diminutive wall, which we ascend
and descend. Then we step across the
park and round the lake. Here and here.
This sepia mark is water. Now we are in
the pleasure garden. This is the hinder
part of the house. Here is the right wing.
The fifth window in the second row. That
is your bull's eye."</p>

<p>"Go on," said his companion,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Your honour will divest yourself of
polished hat and other garments, which you
will transfer to my care in summer house.
Here, behold it, painted in vermilion. You
will climb up to the window. Inferior but
friendly servant has arranged that it shall
open easily. Once in the room the deed is
as good as accomplished. You know the
hiding-place of the jewel."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Travers started. "The hiding-place of
the jewel!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the gloomy Hindoo; "I
know it. But Krishna Bürkut knew it
twenty-five years ago, and the Swâmi Râm
Nâth knew it fifty years ago, and yet another
Swâmi seventy-five years ago, but none of
these restored it to the Temple of Agni. All
failed in their quest, and never regained
their caste. I too shall fail."</p>

<p>"Allow me to have the felicity of indicating
at least one point of difference
between your honour and gentlemen mentioned,"
replied the Baboo. "Your honour
has intelligent assistant, while enumerated
catalogue had not. Have the kindness to
point out fly in our ointment. It is distinguished
by its absence. The jewel is
yours."</p>

<p>"Perish the jewel!" cried the other
Hindoo in a sudden outburst of fury. "Why
couldn't the <i>Huzoor</i> have left it alone, or
have taken another jewel? Why should he
have singled out the one above all others
necessary to the happiness of Agni? And
why should I, of all the priests of the
Temple, be chosen to restore the sacred
stone? Here, with five thousand miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
space between us, I declare to you, Ramma
Lal, I do not fear the wrath of Agni. I
call him humbug. I read Shakespeare. I
write him an ass. I am doubtful even of
Vishnu and Siva."</p>

<p>Travers paid no attention to Ramma
Lal's reproachful reply. He was lost in
amazement. Here, on the very night he
had chosen for purloining the jewel, two
other men were on the same errand. Stop.
There was a reason for their date. They
had mentioned twenty-five, fifty, and seventy-five
years. It was evidently an anniversary.
Every twenty-five years an attempt had to
be made to restore the jewel to the Temple
of Agni. Three attempts had already been
made in vain, and now, on the hundredth
anniversary of the theft by Major Illingworth,
another attempt was in progress.</p>

<p>At any rate, he was forewarned. The
house was a mile and a half away from the
station by the main road on which the
Hindoos were going. He knew a cut across
the fields which shortened the distance by
half a mile. He would gain ten minutes.
In that ten minutes he had to obtain the
Pearl.</p>

<p>The train pulled up at Knowlesworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
station. The two Hindoos stepped out.
Travers followed. He watched them start
along the road; then he briskly cut across
country.</p>

<p>The church clock struck eight as he reached
the terrace in front of the hall. From the
beginning he had matured only one plan of
campaign. He knew the rules of the house,
and he would take advantage of them.
From eight to nine the men-servants were
busy in the dining-room. Anyone could
open the main outer door and enter. He
might, of course, be seen, and in this eventuality
Travers relied upon his being known
to allay suspicion. He was in evening
dress, and temporarily, at any rate, would
strike a servant as being one of the
guests.</p>

<p>The nominal dinner-hour was eight. It
had been his intention to enter at 8.20 in
order to allow for any delay either on the
part of the kitchen or the guests. Dinners
at Knowlesworth were notoriously unpunctual,
and if he entered now he might
run into the house party or meet stragglers
on the stairs. He must wait. But the
Hindoos were marching down the road.
Each instant brought them nearer. In ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&mdash;no,
in eight minutes&mdash;they would be in
the garden. Yet he dare not enter.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently in the shadow of
the great portico. It was now 8.10. He
would make an attempt.</p>

<p>He slowly pushed back the heavy door,
and entered the vestibule. This was cut
off from the hall by big glass doors, and
then by heavy curtains. Still more carefully
he opened the inner door, and then quickly
closed it again. Through the opening had
come the sound of voices and laughter.
They were gathered in the hall before the
fire, waiting for the summons to dinner.
So there he stayed, cursing the unpunctuality
of the house, and unquietly reflecting that
a casual remark as to the present state of
the weather might lead to the glass door
being opened and himself ignominiously disclosed.</p>

<p>And Mary would witness his humiliation.
Nay, she might even be the innocent cause
of it. She was within half a dozen yards
of him now, separated only by some glass
and a curtain. Yet he could not speak to
her&mdash;could not even see her. Ah! that was
her laugh. And that Strathpeffer's raucous
voice. Hang Strathpeffer!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now 8.15. The Hindoos were in
the garden. The situation was distracting.
At any moment they might enter the Temple
room.</p>

<p>Ah! there was the sound of movement
within. The guests trooped past the door.
Their voices died away. All was still.</p>

<p>It was nineteen minutes past eight.
Travers hesitated no longer. He unbuttoned
his top-coat, and, with cap in hand as though
he were a guest just come in from a stroll
before dinner, he opened the hall door.</p>

<p>No one was in sight. He crossed the
hall, and stepped lightly up the stairs. At
their head he passed a maid. She certainly
took him for a guest.</p>

<p>He went straight down the great corridor,
and then branched to the left. It was the
third door ahead. He pulled back the panel
as Mary had shown him, undid the bolt from
within, and entered. The room was in
darkness. He struck a light, half expecting
to find the Hindoo disclosed. No, he was
alone, and the Pearl still there.</p>

<p>It was a room without furniture. In the
centre was a replica of the great idol of
Agni at the temple from which the Pearl
had been looted. The god sat there, smug,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cross-legged, and hideous. The eyes fascinated
the beholder. The left one was of
marble; the right made of a stone worth a
prince's ransom&mdash;the one known throughout
the world as the Black Pearl of Agni. At
the god's knees, their holders resting on the
floor, were two gigantic candles. Travers
lit them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="409" height="500" alt="Baboo raising arms in distress before idol" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A CRY OF DESPAIR ESCAPED HIM.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_51">p. 51.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Then he stepped quickly to the idol, and
sought the left hand of the god. He pressed
the nail of the fourth finger. The god's
right eyelid lifted, and the complete stone
was disclosed. Travers quickly abstracted
it, released the lid, and put the Pearl in his
pocket.</p>

<p>His object was accomplished. But what
was that? Listen.</p>

<p>There was a sound at the window. The
Hindoo was there&mdash;beaten by half a minute.</p>

<p>Travers turned to the door. Then,
impelled by an overpowering curiosity to
see the end of the drama, he slipped to
another window, and got behind the curtain.</p>

<p>There was a faint whistle from below.
Hang it, what a fool he'd been! The Baboo
had seen the momentary disarrangement of
the curtain, and had observed his figure
against the light, and now he was alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his friend. But the latter heeded not.
Perhaps he was too excited to understand,
or even to hear him.</p>

<p>The sash was raised, the curtain pulled
back, and the Hindoo stepped into the room.
He was almost naked, and his bare limbs
shone with a coating of oil. He took one
step forward, and looked up eagerly into
the idol's face. Then a cry of despair
escaped him. The stone for which he had
travelled five thousand miles was not there.
He had lost his caste. It could never be
regained, since he had failed in his quest.
Never again could he see his native land.
Under the crushing blow he sank, a comatose
heap, on the floor.</p>

<p>The minutes passed, and Travers shifted
uneasily behind the curtain. There were
sounds from the garden&mdash;then approaching
footsteps in the corridor. The door was
flung open, and Lord Illingworth burst into
the room, revolver in hand. The Duke of
Strathpeffer followed with other guests, and
some footmen. The Hindoo stared dully at
them, but did not move. He was promptly
seized.</p>

<p>"The Pearl&mdash;where is it?" demanded
Lord Illingworth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hindoo did not reply.</p>

<p>Lord Illingworth pointed to the empty
socket, and repeated the question, but the
Hindoo merely shook his head.</p>

<p>"Search him," said Lord Illingworth.</p>

<p>He was searched, but, of course, nothing
was found.</p>

<p>Lord Illingworth stood over him.</p>

<p>"Where is the Pearl?" he thundered,
but again the Hindoo shook his head.</p>

<p>"Bring in the other man," said Lord
Illingworth.</p>

<p>The Baboo entered, limp and crestfallen,
in charge of two stablemen. A
boy carried a silk hat and some winter
clothing.</p>

<p>"Ask him what he has done with the
Pearl," said the peer.</p>

<p>Ramma Lal put the question.</p>

<p>"I have not got it. It was not here
when I came."</p>

<p>The Baboo repeated this to Lord Illingworth.</p>

<p>"It is a lie," he replied. "It was here
an hour ago. I saw it myself."</p>

<p>"The <i>sahib</i> knows that thou liest," said
Ramma Lal to his friend. "Tell him a finer
tale."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Hindoo only protested his innocence.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" demanded Lord
Illingworth.</p>

<p>"He says," replied the facile Baboo,
"that no sooner had he taken the Pearl
than there was the flash of fire and much
smoke. When it cleared away the stone
had vanished. Doubtless Agni the god had
come for his own."</p>

<p>Lord Illingworth blazed with fury.</p>

<p>"He has swallowed it," he said. "We
shall have to cut him open."</p>

<p>Ramma Lal translated this terrific threat.
The Hindoo gave a yell. Despair lent him
strength. With a serpentine twist he slid
from the grasp of one of his captors and
knocked up the arm of the other. The
window was still open. He sprang through
it into the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Lord Illingworth ran to the window, fired
blindly, and then rushed from the room.
The others followed. Only the Baboo, his
two captors, and the boy with the clothes
remained.</p>

<p>"Come along," said one of the
grooms.</p>

<p>"Stay for one moment, I beseech you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
said Ramma Lal, "and let me worship Agni
the god."</p>

<p>"None of yer blarney," returned the man.
But the other, who was of a romantic temperament,
said, "Wot's the odds? Let the
heathen do it if he wants."</p>

<p>"You see, gentlemen," said the Baboo
eagerly, "it is my very last opportunity.
I shall be lifelong imprisoned for the inauspicious
event of this evening. It is
positively my last appearance in the open.
Let me worship Agni as I do in my own
land. No Englishman has yet witnessed
the entire ceremony. It shall not take long.
I will compress my supplications. Five
minutes will be ample dispensation."</p>

<p>The grooms looked at each other. Their
curiosity settled the matter.</p>

<p>"We'll give you four minutes, so look
sharp," said one.</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Ramma Lal gratefully.
"Agni will bless you for your beneficence."</p>

<p>The men released their hold. One closed
the window, the other shut the door, and
placed himself before it.</p>

<p>Ramma Lal took off his silk hat, muffler,
and coat. He advanced to the idol and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
salaamed low three times. Then he raised
his eyes and sang.</p>

<p>Travers knew the song. It was a ribald
ditty of the bazaars, and it had as much to
do with the worship of Agni as with the
laws of gravitation.</p>

<p>He watched the Baboo with increasing
interest. He had evidently some ulterior
object in view, but what was it? Ah!</p>

<p>Ramma Lal had gradually approached the
idol. Still singing, he had bowed his head
till it had almost touched Agni's knees.
Travers hardly saw the movement of the
hands. Only an Oriental could have done
it so swiftly. The two candles were suddenly
extinguished, and the room was in absolute
darkness.</p>

<p>With loud imprecations the two grooms
rushed to where the Baboo had been&mdash;to
collide with each other, and incidentally
bring down the huge candlesticks. Then
recovering, they dashed about the room in
search of their prisoner, only to seize the
boy who had the clothes. Finally one of
them struck a light.</p>

<p>They were alone with the boy. The
window was again wide open.</p>

<p>The men leaned out. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
moon. The lights of the searchers flashed
in the distance. They turned blankly to
each other.</p>

<p>"There'll be pop to pay for this," said
the boy, who was still suffering from rough
usage in the dark. "You'll both jolly well
get sacked."</p>

<p>"All your blamed fault for lis'nin' to his
tommy rot," said the one man savagely to
his companion.</p>

<p>"Who'd have thought he was so
cunnin'?" rejoined the other. "Wot's the
good of talkin' here? Come out an' look
for him. He may have broke his neck,"
he added hopefully.</p>

<p>Again the lights flashed in the garden,
and then gradually extended beyond.
Travers waited until he was sure there was
no one below. Then he emerged from his
recess, and followed the Indians through
the window. Leaving the park to the
searchers, he kept to the main avenue, and
soon gained the high road. A ten-mile walk
brought him to Dorton junction, where he
just missed the last train to town.</p>

<p>The sun was high when Danby Travers
reached his rooms, and it was late in the
afternoon when he awoke. The morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
papers and his letters were at his bedside.
He at once opened one of the former, curious
to see if there was any reference to the events
of the previous night.</p>

<p>Good heavens! What was this?</p>

<div class='blockquot'><div class='center'>"BURGLARY AND FIRE AT KNOWLESWORTH.<br />

<span class='small'>THE ILLINGWORTH PEARL STOLEN.</span><br />

<span class='small'>THE HALL GUTTED.</span></div>

<p>"Knowlesworth Hall, the historic seat of the
Illingworths, was last night the scene of two extraordinary
events.</p>

<p>"Lord and Lady Illingworth were entertaining
one of their famous week-end parties at dinner
when a daring and successful attempt was made
to steal the celebrated Pearl of Agni, the largest
known black pearl in the world.</p>

<p>"A native Indian was found in a summer house
in the Italian garden by a servant. As several
determined attempts to steal the Pearl had already
been made, the safety of this remarkable jewel
was at once called into question. Lord Illingworth
and his guests hurried to the Temple room, where
the great Pearl was kept, and there found another
native, who was promptly secured. The Pearl was
missing, and the strictest search failed to bring it
to light. It is believed that the thief has swallowed
it, a fact which it is to be hoped that the X-rays
will be able to demonstrate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Owing to gross mismanagement somewhere,
the two natives escaped from custody, and it was
midnight before they were again apprehended&mdash;one
of them at Dorton, in a state of collapse from fear
and cold; the other at Lingfield, defiant, but suffering
from a sprained ankle. They will be brought
up to-morrow at the Dorton Petty Sessions.</p>

<p>"Scarcely had Lord Illingworth and his guests
retired to rest after an exciting evening than they
were again alarmed, this time by an outbreak of
fire in the Temple room. Its cause is unknown,
but the flames, assisted by a high wind, spread with
extraordinary rapidity, in spite of the prompt
measures taken by the Hall fire brigade. Engines
quickly arrived from Lingfield and Dorton, but the
supply of water was totally inadequate, and it soon
became evident that the whole structure was doomed.
At the moment of telegraphing, the fire was raging
furiously, but all sleeping in the house had been
rescued without injury.</p>

<p>"In one night Lord Illingworth has lost his
great family jewel and his ancestral seat. The
'Luck of the Illingworths' seems to have deserted
him.</p>

<p>"It is a remarkable coincidence that a fire consumed
the Hindu Temple of Agni the night that
the Pearl was taken from it by Major Illingworth
in 1803.</p>

<p>"Agni is the Hindu God of Fire."</p></div>

<p>"Thank Heaven, Mary's safe!" ejaculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Travers. "I hope she hasn't had
a great fright." Then, after a pause,
"And Ramma Lal caught, after all! He
deserved a better fate. What an uncommon
good thing I got the Pearl! If I hadn't
taken it, the Indians would have been well
on the way to Bombay with it by now,
and if neither of us had taken it, the stone
might have been burnt up. Would it,
though? There mightn't have been a fire
at all. Rummy notion that Agni should
blaze the whole show in revenge for my
desecration! It shan't interfere with my
feelings of satisfaction. I'm a public benefactor&mdash;an
Illingworth benefactor, anyway.
I shall explain this to my lord at an early
date. Hullo, what's this? A lawyer's
letter. I can tell 'em by the smell. What's
he threatenin' this time?"</p>

<p>But it wasn't a threat. It was simply
an intimation that under the will of Colonel
Thomas Archer, a distant relative lately
deceased, he, Danby Travers, succeeded to
the whole estate, a bequest made "on
account of intrepidity shown in the recent
Iráwadi campaign." The income therefrom,
the solicitor added, was estimated at about
£3,000 per annum, and he would be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to have an expression of Mr. Danby Travers's
wishes with respect to the same.</p>

<p>£3,000 a year! Travers jumped out of
bed and executed a series of gyrations.
£3,000 a year! That meant Mary. But
did it? It was a fortune to him, but how
would Lord Illingworth view it? Well, if
he didn't like it he needn't. Mary and he
were now independent of everybody.</p>

<p>He made his way to the Burglars' meeting
in a blur of happiness. He was rather late.
Other men were there already, and they one
and all congratulated him.</p>

<p>"Aren't you rather premature?" he
asked. "You haven't seen the Pearl yet."</p>

<p>"Bother the Pearl," said Altamont. "We
mean the title."</p>

<p>"What the deuce are you drivin' at?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you seen the papers?"</p>

<p>"Crowds of 'em, and lawyers' letters too.
My head's buzzin' with 'em. What is it this
time?"</p>

<p>"Your cousin tumbled down some stone
steps in Vienna last night, and you are
Lord Travers now&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>Danby sat down. This final stroke of
fortune was too much for him.</p>

<p>"I can't say I'm sorry," he blurted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
length. "Bertram wouldn't have been sorry
if it had been me. And I'm glad about the
title because of&mdash;&mdash;. Here, I say, you
fellows, what's come over the world since
last night?"</p>

<p>"The Black Pearl of the Illingworths has
changed hands, we hope," said the Secretary,
who wanted to start the business of the
evening.</p>

<p>"The Black Pearl has, and the Luck of
the Illingworths went with it. They've had
a fire, and I've got a bequest and a title.
Perhaps you fellows'll be more superstitious
in future. That's what brought my luck,
anyway." Saying which, he produced the
Black Pearl of Agni.</p>

<p>To his unbounded joy and immense surprise
Lord Illingworth received the missing
stone from London during the course of the
next day.</p>

<p>The Indians had been remanded for a
week, pending further inquiries, and as they
had obviously not stolen the jewel after all,
Lord Illingworth declined to prosecute, and
they were released from custody. An unknown
friend interested himself in the
natives. One of them, a Baboo, was sent
back to Bombay by an early steamer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
other, who refused to return to India, thanks
to the same unknown benefactor, was put
in the way of earning his living by teaching
Hindustani. He has since gone over to the
Mohammedan faith.</p>

<p>With repossession of the Pearl, good fortune
came once more to the Illingworths.
In making excavations consequent on rebuilding
the Hall, a coal seam was discovered,
which eventually doubled the family wealth.</p>

<p>The Black Pearl of Agni is now protected
from burglars by many quaint electrical
conceits. When the next anniversary comes
round any Indian visitors will have a very
lively time of it.</p>

<p>Later on in the year a marriage took
place between Mary, younger daughter of
Lord and Lady Illingworth, and Danby,
ninth Baron Travers, a nobleman who had
been mentioned in despatches in the Iráwadi
campaign, and who was not unknown at
Hurlingham. His clubs were the Marlborough,
Brooks's, and the Burglars'.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FELLMONGERS' GOBLET.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Septimus Toft</span>,&mdash;Sir," the letter ran.
"The 'tecs are on the scent. If you want
any further information meet me at the
Blue Lion, Monument, at nine-thirty to-morrow
evening without fail.&mdash;Yours, etc.,
<span class="smcap">J. Driver</span>."</p>

<p>Mr. Toft stared at the letter with much
disgust and more alarm. It was certainly
a regrettable communication for a commercial
magnate, a magistrate, and a pillar
of society to be obliged to attend to. It
would have troubled him had it come before
Bowker had absconded, but now it was
much worse. Bowker would have shared
the anxiety, and interviewed "J. Driver."
He could have guessed on what particular
scent the detectives were engaged, and his
fertile ingenuity would have suggested an
obvious way of circumventing them, whereas
Mr. Toft's unaided vision saw none.</p>

<p>"Nine-thirty to-morrow evening." Mr.
Toft smiled feebly at the humour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
situation. To-morrow evening at eight
o'clock he was advertised to take the chair
at a Young Men's Mutual Improvement
meeting, and the gentleman who was to
deliver the evening's lecture occupied the
post of his Majesty's Solicitor-General. "He
will probably have to prosecute me on
behalf of the Crown," thought Toft; so he
determined to propitiate him by special
attention to his discourse and by frequent
applause.</p>

<p>On the following evening Mr. Toft made
his way to the Blue Lion. The lecture had
not been a success as far as he was concerned.
Try as he might, he could not concentrate
his thoughts on the subject. He had
applauded at wrong places. Once a titter
from the audience had resulted, and the
Solicitor-General had turned on him a look
of pained surprise. In the agony of the
moment he had pulled the table-cloth, and
the glass of water thereon had upset, incidentally
splashing the lecturer. The titter
developed into a laugh, through which a
legal glare had petrified him.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the lecture was over.
The Solicitor-General listened in silence to
Mr. Toft's apologies, and then bowed coldly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Mr. Toft felt that he was lost indeed if it
came to the Law Courts, and hurried away
to his appointment in a state of feverish
anxiety. He had come to the lecture in a
soft wide-awake hat and the oldest top-coat
in his wardrobe. He now donned a woollen
muffler, and put on a pair of smoked glass
spectacles. This was his idea of disguise.
It was simple, but ineffective; for the
highly-respectable mutton-chop whiskers, the
weak mouth, and cut-away chin were as
noticeable as ever. His most casual acquaintance
would have recognised him, and would
merely have concluded that he was engaged
in something disreputable.</p>

<p>At the Monument he dismissed his cab,
and made his way to the Blue Lion Inn.
It was a fifth-rate house in a fourth-rate
street. Mr. Toft had never been in such an
unpleasant place in his life, and he groaned
as he thought that the exigences of commerce
had driven him there in his old age
without even the excuse of foreign competition.</p>

<p>It was 9.45 when he entered the inn,
and he hoped that the quarter-hour he was
late would impress J. Driver with the conviction
that he, Toft, was not at all particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
about keeping the appointment.
Apparently it did strike Mr. Driver in this
way, for as the be-muffled and be-spectacled
gentleman in the soft hat entered the tap-room
a sarcastic voice loudly expressed the
hope that he hadn't permanently injured his
constitution by running. Mr. Toft was
grieved at the publicity given to this remark.
He sat down by the speaker, and murmured
excuses; but Mr. Driver, if it were he, would
have none of them. "When I says 9.30 I
mean 9.30, and not 9.50, nor 9.60, nor yet
9.70. If my time won't suit you, yours
won't suit me. I'm off," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Toft was alarmed. "Sit down,
please," he said, clutching the rising figure.
"I'm sure I'm very sorry. I had made an
engagement before your letter came, and
I couldn't very well put it off. What will
you have to drink?" he added adroitly.</p>

<p>"Gin and bitters," was the prompt response,
and Mr. Driver sat down.</p>

<p>Mr. Toft now had leisure to take stock
of his surroundings. J. Driver was a dark-haired
man with a bold, clean-shaven chin.
His voice was deep and emphatic, and his
eye was piercing. He was broad and muscular,
and would probably be a good boxer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thought Mr. Toft. He glanced at the drinkers
at the other tables, but finding their eyes
were fixed stolidly on him he looked elsewhere.
He had noticed eyes and noses&mdash;that
was all.</p>

<p>"Now to business," said Mr. Driver.
"You know my name, and I know yours.
That's where we're equal. You're in a
beastly hole, and I aren't. That's where
the difference comes in."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Mr. Toft.
"In fact, I haven't the faintest idea what
you are alluding to."</p>

<p>"Garn," said J. Driver, with a dig in the
ribs that made him jump. "Garn! you old
dodger. What about Government contracts?"</p>

<p>"What about them?" asked Mr. Toft,
shrinking from his familiarity.</p>

<p>"What about them?" echoed the other.
"What about work you never did, for which
you've got false receipts? What about
contracts executed with inferior stuff? What
about commissions to officials, tips to men,
and plunder all round?"</p>

<p>Mr. Toft paled at this catalogue of his
business achievements. "You are misinformed,"
he said. "My firm does not do
such things."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>J. Driver thrust his tongue into his cheek.
"Then how did you get your contracts,
Septimus?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By honest competition in the open
market," replied Mr. Toft loftily.</p>

<p>Mr. Driver laughed derisively. "Lord!"
he said at last, "I wish I had your artless
style. Stick to it, Mister, in the prisoner's
dock. It may pull you through."</p>

<p>"I presume you haven't asked me here
simply for the purpose of insulting me?"
said Mr. Toft, with some dignity.</p>

<p>"What a man you are!" Mr. Driver
replied, with unstinted admiration. "You
must be a thought-reader, Septimus&mdash;a
bloomin' thought-reader. You're quite right;
I haven't. I've come for the loan of a key,
and one of your visitin' cards."</p>

<p>"A key?" said Mr. Toft, relieved, though
much surprised.</p>

<p>"The key of the plate chest of the Fellmongers'
Company."</p>

<p>Mr. Toft raised his eyebrows. "You're
joking," he said.</p>

<p>"Do I look like a joker?" replied his
companion fiercely. "Do I look like a
joker?" he repeated loudly, banging his
fist on the table so that all turned their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in the direction of the noise. Mr. Toft
implored him to restrain his feelings.</p>

<p>"Don't rouse 'em then!" said the man.
"Have you got the key on you?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes," responded Mr. Toft.</p>

<p>"Then hand it over."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," began the unhappy
Septimus.</p>

<p>"I'm not your dear anything," said the
other; "so don't you pretend that I am.
I'm as meek and pleasant as a cow to those
that treat me fair and square, but when I'm
irritated I'm a roarin' bull. Hand me the
key."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"You can't. Right'o!" said Mr. Driver,
rising. "At present the Admiralty only
suspect. To-morrow they'll know, and you'll
know too, Septimus Toft, when you get
five years without the option of a fine."</p>

<p>"Please, please don't speak so loudly,"
begged Mr. Toft, beside himself with fears
and anxieties. Then, to put on time whilst
he collected his scattering thoughts, "What
do you want to do with the key?"</p>

<p>"Wear it with my medals, of course,"
said the man sarcastically. "If you want
further pertic'lers you won't get 'em, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
promise to return the key within forty-eight
hours, and all your plate'll be there."</p>

<p>"It's a very extraordinary idea," said
Mr. Toft incredulously.</p>

<p>"It is; and I'm a very extraordinary
man, and you're a bloomin' ordinary one.
Will you let me have the key and a visitin'
card, or not?"</p>

<p>"If anyone asks how you got them what
will you say?"</p>

<p>"Say I took 'em from you while you
were asleep in an opium den, or when we
met in a tunnel&mdash;any blessed thing you
like."</p>

<p>Mr. Toft scarcely heard him. He was
thinking over the pros and cons of the
situation as rapidly as his nervous system
would allow. He was Treasurer of the Fellmongers'
Company, and he alone had the
key of the plate safe. In the ordinary course
of events he would be elected Prime Warden
next year, but if there were any trouble
about the plate he might not be. Better
that, though, than a public exposure of his
business methods. The key might have been
stolen from him. Everyone lost keys now
and then. Of course no one could think
that the theft was to his advantage, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
would save him from all bother at the
Admiralty&mdash;but would it?</p>

<p>"If I let you have the key," he asked,
"how do I know that you won't come in a
similar way again?"</p>

<p>"Give it up," said Mr. Driver. "Never
was good at riddles, and I didn't come here
to be asked 'em neither. What the blazes
do I care about what you'll know or what
you won't know? I know what I know,
and that's enough to account for your hair
bein' so thin on top. If you don't hand
me that key without any more rottin' I'll
just drop this in the first pillar-box I come
across." He pulled out a fat blue envelope
and flourished it in front of Mr. Toft's
blinking eyes. It was addressed to the
Financial Secretary of the Admiralty, and
was marked on one side "Important," and
on the other "Private and Urgent." There
was an immense seal with the impression of
a five-shilling piece.</p>

<p>"Your death-knell's inside," said Mr.
Driver. "Hear it rattle," and he shook the
envelope in Mr. Toft's ear. "But it wants
a stamp, or the Government might not take
it in. On such trifles do our destinies
depend, Septimus. Have you got a stamp?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He put an anticipatory penny on the
table.</p>

<p>Mr. Toft hesitated no longer. From one
end of his watch-chain he detached a gold
key, which he handed covertly to Driver.</p>

<p>"Now your visitin' card."</p>

<p>Mr. Toft produced one, and handed it
over. "You'll give me that letter now,"
he pleaded.</p>

<p>J. Driver shook his head, tore up the
packet, and put it into the fire. "Better
there," he said oracularly. "Now, Toft,
my boy, don't worry. You'll have that key
back by Friday, and all your spoons'll be
in the box. If you don't interfere you'll
never hear of me again, and the Admiralty
won't either; but if you take one step
behind my back I'll do all I've threatened,
and a lot more, and you'll be building
Portland Breakwater on Christmas Day.
By-bye, Septimus."</p>

<p>With this Mr. Driver rose, and stalked
out of the room. After a modest interval
Mr. Toft followed.</p>

<p>At 9 a.m. on the following morning the
bell of the Fellmongers' Company pealed
vigorously. The porter hurried to answer it,
and found a lady on the doorstep. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was neatly dressed, and was strikingly handsome.
She might be twenty-five years old.
A boy carrying a portfolio and a strapped-up
easel stood behind.</p>

<p>"Is this the Fellmongers' Hall?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is, Miss."</p>

<p>"I want to know if you will be good
enough to allow me to copy a painting you
have on your walls? I do not know if it
is necessary to have any written permission,
or where to apply for it."</p>

<p>"The 'All is open to the public under
my supervision," said the porter pompously.
"Come inside, please."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the lady. "Put
those things down, Johnnie. That's right.
I'll let you know when to come for them.
Good-morning."</p>

<p>"We don't often 'ave hartists 'ere, miss,"
remarked the porter, "and I sometimes
thinks as pictures is wasted on gentlemen
dinin' with City Companies. They ain't
runnin' pertic'ler strong on hart just then.
Which one is it you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the title," replied the artist,
"but I shall know the picture when I see
it. It's a portrait."</p>

<p>"P'raps Nicholas Tiffany," the porter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
suggested, "the first warden of the company,
painted by 'Olbein. Born 1455.
Lived to the ripe age of ninety-four, and
died regretted by his sovereign and his
country. His estates were seized by his
creditors. Here he is, miss."</p>

<p>The man opened the door of the Livery
Room, the walls of which were hung with
many pictures. "This is Tiffany," he said,
pointing to a disreputable-looking portrait.</p>

<p>The lady looked at it doubtfully. "The
painting I want is the one nearest to the
door of the plate room," she said.</p>

<p>"Then it's a good bit away from it,
miss. The plate room is off the Banqueting
'All, and they are all windows on that side.
The pictures are opposite."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the lady. "How very
stupidly I have been informed. Please show
me the room."</p>

<p>The porter led the way, and threw open
the door with pardonable pride. "The
Banqueting 'All of the Honourable Company
of Fellmongers!" he exclaimed. It was
the famous hall in which heads of City
Companies and ruling sovereigns are intermittently
entertained. Down one wall were
ranged portraits of eminent fellmongers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The other three were pierced by doors and
windows.</p>

<p>"Which is the plate room?" asked the
lady.</p>

<p>"This is the door of the plate room,"
the porter replied. "Anyone enterin' without
authority, day or night, sets in action
two peals of electric bells, and aut'matic'ly
discharges a revolver shot through the sky-light."</p>

<p>"How very interesting!" the lady remarked.
"Now I must find my picture."
She looked round the room, and finally
selected one.</p>

<p>"Jeremiah Crumpet," said the porter.
"A haberdasher by birth, but eventually
Junior Warden of our Company. Painted
by Merillo. Never gettin' beyond pot'ooks
'imself, he founded the Company's Schools
at Ashby de la Zouch."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that's the man," said the
artist. "I'll bring my things in if I may.
Is there a Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;? Jeckell, thank you.
I should like to see her about some water
for my paints."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Maria," said Mr.
Jeckell some hours later. "If she's a hartist
I ought to be President of the Royal Academy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I never saw such drawin' in my life. She
can't get his face square nohow. He's
smilin' in the picture, but she's made him
lockjawed an' moonstruck. She says if she
can't get him right she'll have to turn him
into a shipwreck. She must be what the
papers call an himpressionist. She spoke
twice about the plate room, so I've wheeled
my chair into the 'all to keep my eye on
her. I'll go back now and see what she's
hup to."</p>

<p>Mr. Jeckell would have wondered less
at her drawing if he could have seen the note
the lady had referred to in his absence:</p>

<p>"An attempt will be made during the
next three days to steal a cup from the plate
chest at the Fellmongers' Hall. For certain
reasons warning of this must not come to
the authorities from without. Apply for
permission to copy painting or to sketch
interior, and watch. Should any other than
the Company's servant enter the plate room
suggest doubt as to his credentials, and do
all you can to secure his arrest. Another
agent will watch the premises from 5 p.m.
to 9 a.m."</p>

<p>While Mr. Jeckell was on his way to his
chair there came another peal from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
front-entrance bell. A man in a bowler
hat, and carrying a handbag, was outside.</p>

<p>"Mr. Toft has sent me for the Nelson
Goblet," he said.</p>

<p>The porter was surprised. "Got a
note?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The guv'ner gave me this," said the
man, handing a card, "and the key."</p>

<p>"What does he want it for?" Mr.
Jeckell asked.</p>

<p>"Got a big guzzle on at 'ome. Wants
to cut an extra dash in centre-pieces."</p>

<p>Mr. Jeckell shook his head gravely, but
made no remark. "Come along," he said
shortly.</p>

<p>He led the way across the vestibule into
the Banqueting Hall, where, behind her easel,
a lady was evidently busy with her picture.
He stopped at a door, which he unlocked,
and both men passed through. Barely had
they done so when the artist ran from behind
her easel into the outer hall. "Mrs. Jeckell!
Mrs. Jeckell!" she called out.</p>

<p>The porter's wife appeared.</p>

<p>"A man has gone into the plate room
with your husband. I'm sure he is a thief.
Warn Mr. Jeckell to get full authority before
he does what this man wants."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gracious me!" cried the alarmed Mrs.
Jeckell. "A thief! He may be murderin'
Samuel!"</p>

<p>She rushed across to the plate room, and
in a minute a storm of voices proceeded
therefrom. Finally the three emerged, two
hot and flurried, and the stranger, looking
cool and determined, carrying a bag in one
hand and a gold cup in the other. The
porter hung on to his arm.</p>

<p>The artist was in front of the door.
When she saw the man with the bag and
cup she gave a little gasp of surprise, and a
wave of colour overspread her face.</p>

<p>The man seemed equally astonished.
"You!" he said at last.</p>

<p>"They're both thieves," whispered Mrs.
Jeckell to her husband. "They're acting
in collision. I'll shout for the perlice while
you keep 'em." And she ran from the
room.</p>

<p>"You are in danger," said the artist
rapidly in French. "Put the cup in your
pocket. Give me the bag, and knock the
porter down."</p>

<p>The man obeyed with the promptitude of
a soldier. Leaving Mr. Jeckell prostrate on
the floor, they hurried from the Hall. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the street door was Mrs. Jeckell, wildly
beckoning to a distant policeman.</p>

<p>"You take down there," said the artist.
"Good-bye." She ran off in the opposite
direction, still holding the bag, and dived
down a side street.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jeckell grew frantically insistent to
the policeman, who now came up. "Which
one?" he puffed.</p>

<p>"The man. No, it's in the bag. Both
of 'em," she cried.</p>

<p>At this moment her husband appeared
at the door, with blood streaming from his
nose. "They've killed Samuel," cried his
horrified wife, running to him; but the
policeman, though he wore the badge of
St. John of Jerusalem on his arm, dashed
down the street after the lady.</p>

<p>By the time he returned, after a fruitless
pursuit, Mr. Jeckell's nose had stopped bleeding.
"Did you hever?" said the porter.
"What the blazes did she mean by first
givin' the alarm and then aidin' and abettin'?
And she looked so innercent-like, too. The
first hartist as I've ever encouraged, and the
larst. Whatever will Mr. Toft say, Maria?
It's as much as my place is worth. After
all these years of faithful service, too!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Toft was less demonstrative than
might have been expected.</p>

<p>The next gathering of the Burglars' Club
proved the most important in the history
of the Club since its foundation. Every
detail of it is firmly impressed on the memory
of each member present; yet they never by
any chance refer to that meeting. One and
all would like to forget it&mdash;if they could.</p>

<p>It was held at Marmaduke Percy's rooms,
his Grace of Dorchester, the President of
the year, being in the chair.</p>

<p>The Secretary read the minutes, and
concluded: "The business of the evening is
the payment of an entrance fee&mdash;the Nelson
Goblet of the Fellmongers' Company&mdash;by
Martin Legendre Craven, fourth Baron
Horton, a cadet member of the Club."</p>

<p>Lord Horton entered, bowed, and amidst
general applause, placed on the table a
richly-chased goblet of gold.</p>

<p>"Lord Horton's entrance fee being paid,"
said the President, "I now move that he
be enrolled as a full member." Carried
unanimously.</p>

<p>"My lord, you are one of us."</p>

<p>Lord Horton advanced to the table and
looked round with calm deliberation. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was a notable man&mdash;the best amateur low
comedian of his day, a traveller who had
pressed far into Thibet, a diplomatist at the
mention of whose name the Turk shifted
uneasily in his seat and fixed his eyes
despondently on the floor. He had won his
V.C. in China. He had done many things.</p>

<p>"Your Grace, my lords and gentlemen,"
he said. "I thank you. In accordance with
the usual custom of your Club I will explain
how I have been able to fulfil my appointed
duty. I received an intimation that the
Nelson Goblet of the Fellmongers' Company
was my entrance fee, and at once took steps
to procure it. The matter was hardly difficult.
A list of the Company showed me
that the treasurer and plate-keeper was a
certain Mr. Toft. The directory informed
me that he was a steam-tug owner and a
contractor to the Admiralty. Inquiry there
told me he was under suspicion of bribery
and corruption. I played on this little weakness
of his, and, if I am not mistaken, I
frightened him into the paths of virtue for
the rest of his days. In return, he lent me
the key of the plate safe of his Company.
In broad daylight I proceeded for my booty.
To my surprise, I found that I was expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Someone had placed an agent on the spot
to warn the custodian of the building of
my intention. An alarm was raised. My
lords and gentlemen, at whose instigation
was that alarm raised?"</p>

<p>Lord Horton paused. Members looked at
each other in mystified amazement. What
on earth was he driving at? Was he waiting
for a reply?</p>

<p>The silence grew painful. "Who instigated
that alarm?" again the speaker asked.</p>

<p>A voice replied, "Presumably Mr. Toft."</p>

<p>"'Presumably Mr. Toft.' Sir Francis
Marwood, I thank you for the suggestion.
To continue. An alarm was raised by the
agent of someone unknown. This agent was
a lady who did not know that she was
betraying an old friend. A minute later we
were face to face. Instantly she pierced
through my disguise, and by her presence of
mind and fertility of resource alone did I
escape."</p>

<p>"Like Sir Francis Marwood, I thought
my betrayer was Mr. Toft, and I hastened
to interview that gentleman. I found him
in a state of extreme nervous prostration,
but I left him convinced that it was not
he who had betrayed me. So your suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Sir Francis Marwood, is wrong. Can you
give me another clue?"</p>

<p>Sir Francis did not reply. He looked
uncomfortable at the attention bestowed upon
his remark.</p>

<p>"My next step was to trace the lady
who had helped me. That also was not
difficult. I did not know she was in
England, but being here I concluded that
the Foreign Office would have her address.
I was not mistaken. I found my friend,
and learnt that she had her instructions to
raise an alarm from&mdash;mark the name well,
gentlemen&mdash;from Sir Francis Marwood, a
member of this Club."</p>

<p>Had a live shell fallen into their midst
it would probably have caused less consternation
than did this announcement.
There was an involuntary exclamation from
everyone. For a moment all eyes were fixed
on Sir Francis. Then each man drew himself
up and stared blankly into space.</p>

<p>"The fame of your Club had reached
me, and the novelty of its membership
appealed to me." Again Lord Horton was
speaking. "I felt that its risks would give
a pleasing zest to civilian life, but I did not
know that members were allowed to pay off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
old scores on each other through its medium.
Last year I considered it my duty to advise
against Sir Francis Marwood's appointment
to Lisbon. This was his revenge. I was
prepared to run any and all risks from without,
but did not anticipate betrayal from
within. Gentlemen, you have done me the
honour to elect me as a member of your
Club. I have paid my subscription. Now
I beg to tender my resignation."</p>

<p>"No, no!" responded on all sides. Then
cries of "Marwood! Marwood!"</p>

<p>"Order!" called the Duke. "Sir Francis
Marwood, we are waiting."</p>

<p>Sir Francis rose. He was a man of some
distinction in the diplomatic world.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, making a desperate
attempt to speak his words lightly; "I
really did not anticipate the matter would
be taken up in this serious way. I do not
dispute the accuracy of Lord Horton's statement,
though I absolutely deny the motive
he has ascribed to me. The reason of my
action was simple. This Club was formed
by us, not merely for passing time, but for
keeping up our wits in degenerate days. To
such a man as Lord Horton I felt that the
purloining of the Fellmongers' Goblet must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fall flat indeed. I have read the marvellous
account of his adventures in Thibet, and
I felt that some further spice of danger in
this particular affair was necessary to make
it worthy of Lord Horton's reputation. I
took the liberty of supplying it, though
perhaps in so doing I exceeded my rights.
If so, I tender my regrets."</p>

<p>Sir Francis resumed his seat amidst loudly
expressed disapprobation.</p>

<p>The President rose. "Gentlemen," he
said, "you have heard Lord Horton's charge
and Sir Francis Marwood's reply. Our Club
can exist only as long as there is absolute
good faith between its members, and I never
dreamt of anything less than this being
possible. Two duties are obviously mine.
The first, Sir Francis Marwood, is to inform
you that you are no longer a member of the
Club. The second is to express our sincere
regrets to Lord Horton, and our earnest
hope that he will reconsider his resignation."</p>

<p>Sir Francis rose, pale and defiant. "So
be it, Duke. Some day you may regret
this. Horton, you and I have a big score
to wipe out now." Then, with an ugly
sneer, "It is hardly necessary to say that
the F.O. will no longer require the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of a lady who cannot be depended upon;
but Lord Horton's interest will no doubt
find her another situation."</p>

<p>"Stop!" thundered Horton. "A lady
has been mentioned. Two years ago this
same lady saved my life in Russia. I asked
her to marry me, and she refused, because,
absurdly enough, she thought it would spoil
my career. We did not meet again till yesterday.
Marwood, instead of an injury, you
did me the greatest service in the world.</p>

<p>"A week ago I was offered the post of
British Agent at Kabul. It was a post
after my own heart, but single-handed I
should have failed in it. With this lady
as my wife anything would be possible.
Yesterday I begged her to reconsider her
decision, and to help me in my career. I
am proud to say she consented. We are
to be married at once. Because bachelors
alone are eligible as members of your Club,
I am forced to confirm my resignation.
Gentlemen, and Sir Francis Marwood, good-evening."</p>

<p>Thus did Lord Horton leave the Burglars'
Club for married life, happiness, and his
brilliant after-career.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2>V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN OUNCE OF RADIUM.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> seems likely," said the President, with
singular irrelevance, "that there will be a
slump in radium."</p>

<p>"All South Africans are down," remarked
Chillingford gloomily. "What in the world
are you fellows laughing at?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a mine, Tommy. It's a horse. Won
the Nobel Stakes," Marmaduke Percy called out.</p>

<p>"Order, gentlemen, if you please," continued
the President. "I was remarking
on the probability of a slump in radium.
This is what to-day's paper says:</p>

<p>"'£896,000 was recently quoted as the
market price for a single pound of radium.
We suggest that it would be advisable for
any holder to realise promptly, as Professor
Blyth has discovered a method of obtaining
this remarkable element from a substance
other than pitch-blende. He has already
isolated one ounce avoirdupois&mdash;at yesterday's
price worth £56,000&mdash;which has been
exhibited to a select number of scientists
at his laboratory at Harlesden Green.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It seems likely that radium will no
longer remain the toy of the conversazione,
but that it will take its place among the
great forces of civilisation. As a moderate-sized
cube of it is sufficient to warm the
dining-room of an average ratepayer for
something like two thousand years, we shall
no doubt find in this element the motive
power of the future. The smoke nuisance
of our great towns will disappear, ocean coaling
stations will no longer be necessary, and incidentally
about a million workers in the coal
trade will be thrown out of employment.'</p>

<p>"This, gentlemen, is from the <i>Daily
Argus</i> of to-day."</p>

<p>"Take your word for it, old man,"
"Carried <i>nem. con.</i>," and sundry other
similar cries greeted the speaker.</p>

<p>The Duke waved his hand disparagingly.
"Our secretary informs me," he went on,
"that the subscription of Major Everett
Anstruther is now due. It is suggested that
he should produce this £56,000 worth of
radium at our next meeting in payment
thereof; although I believe that is something
less than the value of membership
of our Club."</p>

<p>That is why, on April 4th last, Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Everett Anstruther climbed the wall at the
back of Professor Blyth's house at Harlesden.</p>

<p>His methods were those of the average
burglar. He forced back the catch of one
of the windows, drew up the sash, and stepped
gently down from the window-sill into the room.</p>

<p>He was in the Professor's laboratory, a
one-storeyed building joined to the dwelling-house
by a corridor.</p>

<p>Anstruther turned on his portable electric
light, and took his bearings. He was in an
ordinary scientific laboratory, surrounded by
induction coils, Crookes' tubes, balances, prismatic
and optical instruments, and other and
more complicated apparatus, the use of which
he could not guess.</p>

<p>He walked slowly round, observing every
corner. Where was the radium? He had read
up the subject, and had learnt of its power to
penetrate almost any substance, and now he
turned off his light, hoping to see its rays.</p>

<p>There was nothing but absolute darkness.</p>

<p>He resolved to explore further. He
opened the door gently. In front of him
was the passage leading to the house. At
his left another door&mdash;wide open.</p>

<p>He stopped before it in mute surprise
and admiration.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>On a table in the middle of the room was
a luminous mass. The wall behind was
aglow with a dancing, scintillating light.
The rest of the room was in darkness, save
for the dim light cast by the glowing mass
and the phosphorescent screen behind.</p>

<p>It was the radium! How could the
Professor leave it in so exposed a place?
No doubt it was there that it had been
exhibited to the scientists&mdash;but £56,000
worth left on a table for anyone to handle!
It was absurd. Only a professor would have
done it.</p>

<p>But it wasn't for him to grumble at the
peculiar methods of learned men, and with
a cheerful heart Anstruther stepped lightly
into the room.</p>

<p>As he did so the door closed behind him
with a click. The Major paused. "That's
queer," he thought. "I didn't feel a
draught, and I didn't touch the door."</p>

<p>Luckily the laboratory was isolated from
the rest of the house, so the slight noise
would not have been heard. He waited for
some minutes to reassure himself; then he
stepped back to the door and gently turned
the knob, without result. He pushed; pulled
and pushed; lifted and pushed; pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
down and pushed; tried in every way he
could think of, but the door would not open.</p>

<p>He examined it carefully. Save for its
knob its surface was absolutely plain. There
was no keyhole or latch.</p>

<p>"Trapped, by Jove!" Anstruther exclaimed
under his breath; and as his unpleasant
situation dawned upon him he felt
more uncomfortable than he had ever done in
his life before. In fact, he felt physically ill.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" he thought. "It's
deuced annoying, but it isn't as bad as all
that. I don't know why it should bowl me over.
Perhaps there's another way out of this den."</p>

<p>He walked round the room, feeling the
wall for some shutter, even searching the
floor for a trap-door. There was none.
Save for a telephone and the table, he
encountered nothing but plain surface.</p>

<p>"Of all the infernal holes to be in," he
muttered. "Trapped like this, and all
through my own carelessness." And then
it occurred to him that he, Everett
Anstruther, late a major of his Majesty's
Horse Guards Blue, and now member of
Parliament for Helston, would in a few hours
be haled away to prison on a charge of attempted
burglary. A pleasant situation, truly!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt ill&mdash;worse than before. His head
ached, and his temples throbbed. What on
earth did it mean? He had been in tight
places before&mdash;once in Italy, when his life
wasn't worth a moment's purchase, and then
he was absolutely cool. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="Man talking on the wall phone" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;YOU ARE A THIEF.&#39;&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_93">p. 93.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>He started as if a pistol had been fired.
A bell had rung behind him&mdash;an electric
bell. It was the telephone bell, and it was
still ringing. He watched it in dismay. It
would rouse the whole house. Lift down
the receiver, of course. He did so. The bell
stopped. He put the receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" a voice asked.</p>

<p>He did not reply. There was no need.
While the receiver was off the bell wouldn't
ring.</p>

<p>"If you don't answer I shall wake the
house," came the voice, as if in answer to
his thoughts.</p>

<p>The Major groaned inwardly. "Yes, I'm
here," he replied.</p>

<p>"Good. How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty tollollish," he answered.
"Must be the doctor," he thought.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Smithers," said the Major, with a
sudden inspiration. "John Smithers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"John Smithers," came the slow response.
"Thank you. Your age last birthday?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me he has been examining
Blyth's factotum for life insurance," thought
the Major. "Lucky I caught on so well.
But what an extraordinary idea to collect
these statistics at something after midnight."</p>

<p>"Age last birthday, please," came down
the wire again.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five," replied the Major. "Nothing
like the truth in an emergency," he
added to himself.</p>

<p>"John Smithers, aged thirty-five," was
repeated. "Late occupation?"</p>

<p>"Soldier."</p>

<p>"Good. Very good. Late occupation,
soldier. Any pension?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What a fool you are to risk it for a
bit of radium."</p>

<p>The Major stepped back in sheer amazement.
"What did you say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whatever made you risk your pension
for a bit of radium?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Then I'll explain. You are a thief,
locked up in Professor Blyth's dark room.
Isn't that so?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Major in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Professor Blyth."</p>

<p>"The devil!" Anstruther ejaculated.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;Professor Blyth," came the
response.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" asked the Major.</p>

<p>"I am in the room at the end of the
corridor. I can observe the door of your
room from where I stand, and I have a
loaded revolver in my hand."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon you. I can either
send for the police, and give you in charge,
or I can take scientific observations with
your assistance&mdash;whichever you prefer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by scientific
observations?"</p>

<p>"You are locked up in a room twelve
feet square with an ounce of radium."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You are the first man in the world
who has been locked up with an ounce of
radium in a room twelve feet square, and your
sensations would be of scientific value. If
you care to describe them to me by telephone
so long as you are conscious, I will not
prosecute; otherwise I will place the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the hands of the police. Which do you
prefer to do?"</p>

<p>"You are remarkably kind to offer me
the alternative. I think I prefer to describe
my sensations."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am really very much
obliged to you, John Smithers; but I ought
to warn you beforehand that you will be
put to great personal inconvenience. If you
decide to try the experiment I shall not
release you for some hours. I shall certainly
not break off in the middle, however
ill you feel."</p>

<p>"I have told you my choice," said
Anstruther curtly.</p>

<p>"Right. Stop, though. What sort of a
heart have you?"</p>

<p>"Strong."</p>

<p>"Good. You'll need it. Got a watch?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you take your pulse?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are a real treasure, John Smithers.
I'm glad you called. You've been fifteen
minutes in the room. What is your pulse?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-three."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Can you read a clinical
thermometer?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On the ledge of the telephone, where
the paper is, you will find a tube. Got it?
There's a thermometer inside. Please take
it out, and read it carefully."</p>

<p>"Ninety-seven," said the Major.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I had no idea the army
was so intelligent. How the papers do
deceive us! Now put the thermometer under
your tongue for two minutes, and then let
me know what it registers."</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine," came the eventual response.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Horse or foot soldier,
Smithers?"</p>

<p>"Horse."</p>

<p>"Horse. Thank you. Married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good again, Smithers. No one dependent
upon you, I hope? Have you a headache?"</p>

<p>"It's enough to give me one, answering
all your questions."</p>

<p>"Please describe symptoms, and not attempt
to diagnose them. Have you a headache?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How's your heart?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beats irregularly."</p>

<p>"Probably it will. Respiration?"</p>

<p>"It's rather choky here. Can't you let
me have a breath of fresh air?"</p>

<p>"On no account, Smithers&mdash;on no account.
I'm surprised at your suggesting
such a thing. That will do for the present.
I'll ring up again shortly, and I'm always
here if you want me. You might take a
little gentle exercise now."</p>

<p>The major hung up his receiver. The
room seemed to be much lighter now. The
radium glowed more brightly, and the scintillations
on the wall behind had increased
in intensity. He advanced towards the
radium, and was immediately conscious
that his discomfort increased. There was a
smarting sensation on the front of his body,
as if it were exposed to fire. His breathing
became more difficult, his headache increased.
He drew back to the wall, and the symptoms
became less marked.</p>

<p>The bell rang again. "I ought to inform
you, Smithers," said the voice, "that no
good at all would result from your attempting
to destroy the radium. As a matter of
fact, if you broke or crushed it you would
feel very much worse. The particles would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fly all over, and you would inhale them.
The symptoms would be intensely interesting
if you would care to experience them,
but I won't answer for the consequences.
I just want you to understand that you
can't possibly escape from this important
new element when once you are imprisoned
in a room with it, especially when the room
is only twelve feet square."</p>

<p>The major did not reply. He hung up
his receiver in silence.</p>

<p>At the other end of the telephone was
Robert Blyth, F.R.S., D.Sc., etc., etc., a little
red-haired man, whose researches on the
Mutilation and Redintegration of Crystals
are of world-renown.</p>

<p>He was a grave little man as a rule.
Only when on the verge of some discovery,
or when watching the successful progress
of an experiment, did he wax cheerful. He
did this now as he surveyed his notes of
the report of John Smithers, a horse-soldier,
in durance vile in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"Pulse, 73; temperature, 99; heart,
irregular. Good. Respiration difficult. Well,
that's understandable. He's been in there
thirty-one minutes. Thanks to a strong constitution,
he's scarcely felt anything yet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
but now he'll have trouble. John Smithers,
you are going to have an exceedingly bad
time of it. If you weren't a criminal I
should hesitate in giving it you. As it is,
you must suffer for the cause of science.
Your experience will, no doubt, make you
hesitate before you attempt another crime."</p>

<p>The professor tilted back his chair.
"Strange," he mused, "how brain controls
matter to the end. Here's John Smithers
in the next room&mdash;a strong man admittedly&mdash;cribbed,
cabined, and confined by a man
he could probably crumple up with one
hand. It was a stroke of genius to advertise
my discovery in the papers. The criminal
classes all read them now, and I thought I
should probably attract a thief. I placed
the radium in the middle of the room, and
painted the wall behind with sulphide of
zinc so that he couldn't possibly miss it. I
easily constructed a threshold that closed the
door when stepped upon. And then I had
only to wait."</p>

<p>Here the bell rang. "Aha, Smithers,
you are growing impatient. Well?"</p>

<p>"Are you a Christian?" came the reply.</p>

<p>"I hope so. Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you call this Christian conduct, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
imprison me here with this infernal block
of fire? I tell you, man, it's poisoning me.
It's choking me. It's getting to my brain.
If you are a Christian, come down and let
me out."</p>

<p>"None of that hysterical sort of talk,
Smithers," said the Professor sternly. "It's
no good appealing for mercy. You are a
thief, and you've got to be punished. Pull
yourself together, and show what you are
made of. You don't know what a lot of
good your sufferings may do to humanity.
I shall publish a full account of them in the
<i>British Medical Journal</i>, and I am sure your
family will be proud of you when they
read it."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a family, and if I had
they shouldn't read your jibberings. I tell
you that if you don't let me out I shall do
something desperate!"</p>

<p>"You can't," said the Professor.
"There's nothing in the room except the
radium and the telephone. If you knock
the radium about you'll only make things
worse for yourself, and if you damage the
telephone you cut off your only link with
the outside world. Be a man, Smithers.
You've read of the Black Hole of Calcutta.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The sufferings of the prisoners there were
far worse than yours."</p>

<p>"You are a scientific vampire&mdash;a howling
chemical bounder!" came the response.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said the Professor serenely.
"Do try and be calm. Take a stroll round.
You might put the thermometer under your
tongue again, and let me have the record.
Nothing like filling your leisure moments
with useful occupation."</p>

<p>"Poor beggar!" he said to himself.
"He's just beginning to realise things. Five
centigrammes of radium chloride killed eight
mice in three days; how long will it take
an ounce of radium bromide to render a
strong man insensible? That's the problem
in rule of three, and it's high time that
someone worked out the answer.</p>

<p>"Well?" in reply to the bell.</p>

<p>"Temperature, 102; pulse, 100. Look
here, Blyth, I'm going dotty. If you won't
have pity on me as a Christian, I appeal
to you as a family man. Your people
wouldn't like to hear of this, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Pulse 100," repeated the Professor.
"Jerky, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Did you hear my appeal to you as a
family man?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Smithers, you agreed to help me
with my scientific observations, and I wish
you'd keep to the letter of the agreement.
Is your pulse jerky?"</p>

<p>"It is, and my hands are fairly itching
to close round your throat, and my toes
would like to kick you into eternity. Blyth,
if I die, I'll haunt you and your family to
the fifth generation. If you don't end up
in a madhouse it won't be my fault. You
scoundrel! You contemptible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the Professor hung up the receiver.
"Strange," he soliloquised, "how mentally
unbalanced these common men are! I can't
imagine myself giving way to such ravings,
whatever situation I was in. That's the
advantage of birth and education. Yet,
judging from the way in which Smithers
expresses himself, he must be a man of very
fair education. It's birth alone that tells
in the long run," and the Professor stroked
his stubble chin complacently.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. "He ought to be
feeling it now. I'll ring him up." The Professor
did so, but there was no reply.
"He can't have collapsed already&mdash;a horse-soldier
of thirty-five." Once more he rang.
This time there was a slow response.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you come before?" said
the Professor irately.</p>

<p>"I'm not your servant. I was thinking
how I'd like to chop you into mincemeat,
Blyth, and scatter you to the crows. My
head's splitting&mdash;splitting, do you hear? I
shall go dotty, looking at this infernal heap
of fire. Those moving specks of light behind
are all alive, Blyth. They're grinning at me.
They're choking me. And there you sit like
a scientific panjandrum with a little round
button on top. And you call yourself a
Christian and a respectable family man.
You are a disgrace to your country. Come
down and let me out. Send for the police.
I don't care."</p>

<p>"Smithers," said the Professor, "I'm
ashamed of you. A horse soldier going on
like a nurserymaid! I shall not send for
the police. You agreed to this experiment,
and you've got to see it through. Please
remember that. How's your pulse?"</p>

<p>"Blyth, it's 120! It's ticking like a
clock. I believe it's going to strike."</p>

<p>"Keep cool, Smithers. Have your hands
a bluish tinge?"</p>

<p>"They seem to be green."</p>

<p>"Green?   Preposterous!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"They may be blue really. I'm colour
blind."</p>

<p>"Colour blind, Smithers, and a soldier?
I'm surprised at you. I suspect they're
only dirty. Do you feel a tingling at the
finger tips?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and at my toe-tips too."</p>

<p>"Excellent! And your temperature?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and three. Man, I'm in
a fever. I can't breathe. My head's on
fire."</p>

<p>"You've only been in there an hour and
a quarter. You're just beginning to get
acclimatised, Smithers," said Professor Blyth
callously, as he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"I wish Cantrip were here," he soliloquised.
"'Deoxygenation of the blood corpuscles,
followed by coma.' Bah! Radium
acts on the nerve centres, and will ultimately
produce paralysis. Cantrip is an ass. I
always told him so."</p>

<p>The bell rang. "Blyth," said the prisoner,
"listen to me. If you don't let me out, I'll
swallow the radium. It can't make me feel
worse, and it may finish me off quicker."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Smithers, don't talk like a
fool. It would only add to any&mdash;er&mdash;inconvenience
you are now experiencing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care what it would do. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Professor cut him off impatiently.
"I'm disappointed in John Smithers," he
thought. "He has no stamina. A man of
low birth, evidently. A mere mountain of
muscle. I know the species."</p>

<p>For a while he paced the room. Then he
rang the bell, but this time there was no
coherent response. The gasps sounded like,
"Sit on her head, Blyth&mdash;keep her down,
man. Whoa, mare!&mdash;mind that fencing&mdash;snow
again&mdash;what ho! she bumps&mdash;all down
the road and round the corner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, keep cool, Smithers,"
cried the Professor. "I want some more
observations. Don't lose your head yet.
You've all the night in front of you."</p>

<p>"Squadron, right wheel! Draw swords!
Charge! Down with 'em! Boers, Japs,
and Russians. Get home, lads! Give it 'em
hot! Hurrah! I've killed a sergeant-major."
Then indistinct mumbling and cackling
laughter came through the telephone.</p>

<p>The Professor was disturbed. The end
had come sooner than he had expected, for
John Smithers had only been there an hour
and a half, and he had calculated on a much
longer time. But the symptoms were, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the whole, what he had expected. Green
hands, though. What if the extremities were
blue after all, and Cantrip right?</p>

<p>He rang the bell. There was no response.
Once more, and yet again. Still
there was silence.</p>

<p>The Professor hung up the receiver
gloomily. "I'm afraid I shall have to go
to him. He's unconscious, and continued
exposure might be serious."</p>

<p>He went down the corridor, pulled back
the bolts, and opened the door. The room
was in absolute darkness. The Professor was
intensely surprised. "What on earth has he
done with the radium?" he thought. "Good
heavens! Surely he hasn't really swallowed
it!"</p>

<p>He stepped carefully across the threshold
towards the electric pendant in the centre
of the room. He started. The door had
closed behind him with a loud click. He
switched on the light, and peered round the
floor for John Smithers. He was alone.
Neither Smithers nor the radium was there!</p>

<p>At that moment the telephone rang.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" came a voice.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Smithers?" said the Professor,
in blank amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is, Blyth. How's your temperature?
You'll find the thermometer on the telephone
where you left it."</p>

<p>"You scoundrel! You consummate
scoundrel! How did you get out?"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Blyth, keep cool."</p>

<p>"If you don't release me immediately
I'll hand you over to the police."</p>

<p>"You can't get 'em, old man. You can
only talk to me."</p>

<p>"What have you done with the radium?"</p>

<p>"Got it here, Blyth; and I'm taking
ever such a lot of care of it. I read all
about it before I came, and I know just
what it fancies. I brought a nice quarter-inch
thick lead case, with a smaller one fixed
inside, and the half-inch of intervening space
made up with quicksilver. I've had the
radium in the inner case most of the time,
and it's as quiet as a lamb, nicely bottled
up with its rays. In fact, I think it's gone
to sleep. I've had quite a cheerful time with
you to talk to, Blyth. You don't know how
amusing you've been."</p>

<p>"Smithers," stuttered the Professor, "you
are an insolent fellow as well as a consummate
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Blyth! Do keep cool. Think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
how humanity will benefit from your present
inconvenience. I'll look out for your article
in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, and I won't
contradict it, though my pulse never went
above seventy-three nor my temperature over
ninety-nine, and wouldn't have done that
if I'd bottled the radium at once instead
of stopping to chatter with you. But you
really ought to have kept a smarter look-out
as you went in. I nearly brushed against
you as I closed the door behind me. Well,
bye-bye, old man, and many thanks for the
radium. It will help my pension out nicely.
I'll leave the receiver off the telephone, so
that you don't disturb your family. I
wouldn't worry, Blyth. Think of the Black
Hole of Calcutta, and be a man!"</p>

<p>Before Anstruther had reached the
laboratory the Professor was hammering on
the wall, and shouting at the top of his
voice. The Major hurried through the window,
climbed the garden wall, and had found
his bicycle before the prisoner was released.
By the time that the police were informed,
he was well on his way to town.</p>

<p>And that is how Major Everett Anstruther
was able to renew his subscription to the
Burglars' Club.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BUNYAN MS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Anstruther</span> sat down amidst vociferous
applause.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Duke, "I think
we may heartily congratulate Major Anstruther
on the foresight and ingenuity displayed
in renewing his subscription. I am
sorry we cannot keep the radium as a
memento, but, according to our rule, it
has to be returned to Professor Blyth at
once. This particular burglary has been
so satisfactory that I think we may with
advantage again turn to the daily Press
for our next item. I read yesterday&mdash;&mdash; Let
me see&mdash;where is it? I cut out the
paragraph. Ah! here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Yet another priceless possession is
leaving the Eastern hemisphere. Thirty
pages of 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' all that
is left of that immortal work in the handwriting
of John Bunyan, has been waiting
for offers at Messrs. Christie's rooms since
November last. The highest bid from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the United Kingdom was £45 10s., at which
price the precious manuscript did not change
hands. We now hear that £2,000 has been
offered and accepted. The purchaser is Mr.
John Pilgrim, the Logwood King, of New
York. At the present rate of denudation
it seems likely that fifty years hence the
original of Magna Charta will be the only
historical manuscript left in the country.'"</p>

<p>"Shame&mdash;shame!" greeted the reading
of the paragraph.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you agree with the
newspaper," said the Duke blandly. "I
read that paragraph at breakfast yesterday,
and since then I have learnt that Lord
Roker's subscription is due. It seems to
me more than a coincidence that these two
matters should come together. It is a
national disgrace that the manuscript of
that remarkable, I believe unparalleled&mdash;er&mdash;effort
of Mr. Bunyan should leave the
country. For one night longer, at any rate,
it must remain in the possession of Englishmen.
My lord of Roker, you will kindly
produce the Bunyan MS. at our next meeting,
on the 23rd inst., in settlement of your
subscription."</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. on Monday, April 18th last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a new arrival registered himself in the
visitors' book at the Ilkley Hydropathic
Establishment as James Roker, Jermyn
Street, S.W. He was a good-looking,
straight-built man of thirty or thereabouts.
He was of an unobtrusive disposition, but
was obviously well-informed, for in the
smoke-room after dinner, when in a discussion
on the internal resources of Japan,
the date of Queen Anne's death came up,
the new arrival gave it authoritatively as
1745, and so settled the matter.</p>

<p>The next morning brought letters
addressed to Lord Roker. Five minutes
after the arrival of the post the news spread,
and at breakfast he was the cynosure of
all eyes.</p>

<p>It was the first time that a nobleman
had stayed at the Hydro, excepting the
doubtful instance of Count Spiegeleisen in
1893, but to provide for possible emergencies
the management had thoughtfully placed a
Peerage on the bookshelves. This volume
was now thoroughly investigated, and it was
learnt that James, Lord Roker, was heir to
the Earldom of Challoner, and that he was
born on April 25th, 1870. His birthday
obviously would occur the following week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and an enterprising lady suggested the propriety
of arranging for a concert and a
representation of Mrs. Jarley's waxworks in
honour of the occasion.</p>

<p>The only person in the place who seemed
annoyed by his arrival was Mr. John Pilgrim,
a gentleman from New York.</p>

<p>"That's why he was so darned civil to
me last night," he thought. "He knows
how fond Fifth Avenue girls are of the
British peerage, and he thinks he's only got
to drop his handkerchief for Marion to pick
it up. I call it a bit thick of him. I'm
glad she's away for the day. I asked him
to look round this evenin', so reckon I'll
have to be civil; but I'll stand no nonsense.
If he tries his sawder on me durin' the day
I'll let him know."</p>

<p>There was no occasion&mdash;or, indeed, opportunity&mdash;to
let Lord Roker know anything
during the day, for he went to Rylstone
the first thing after breakfast, and only
re-appeared at dinner-time.</p>

<p>The toilettes of at least eighteen ladies
were more elaborate than usual that evening,
but they were lost on Lord Roker, who,
after half an hour in the smoke-room, tapped
on Mr. Pilgrim's door at 8.30.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evenin', my lord," said Mr. Pilgrim,
with studied politeness. "Will you sit
there? Cigar, sir? I can recommend these.
I hope you had a pleasant day. How do
you like the Hydro?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lord Roker, as he
took the Bock, and settled himself in the
chair indicated. "I have been away in the
country all day, so I haven't seen much of
the Hydro yet. It seems all right. At any
rate, you have got pretty snug quarters."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Pilgrim, with some complacency.
"You see, I'm samplin' the British
Isles, gettin' the best I can lay hands on,
and am storin' my purchases here. This
room is furnished with Heppendale an'
Chipplewhite's masterpieces, collected by my
daughter. Paintin's by Jones an' Rossetti.
In the nex' cabin I've got those historical
sundries I mentioned. But before we look
at them I want you to give me some information."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to do so, if I have it."</p>

<p>"You have it, sir. I may as well explain
what I want. I have come over to see
Europe for the first time, but I wanter
know more about it than Americans do
as a gen'ral rule. I'm not content to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Shakespeare's tomb an' see over Windsor
Castle, and then think I've done the old
country. I wanter know the people who
inhabit her to-day, and you can't get to
know them on board trains. That's why
I've come to this Hydro. I get here what
my secretary calls a symposium of the whole
nation. So I'm studyin' people here with
the idea of writin' a book on my return.
What are your views on things in gen'ral,
my lord?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, that's a big order. But I
may say I'm pretty well satisfied with things
in general."</p>

<p>"You are an hereditary legislator, I
believe," said Mr. Pilgrim.</p>

<p>"I may be some day," replied Lord
Roker; "but at present I am not."</p>

<p>"Then what is your pertic'ler line in
life?"</p>

<p>"If you mean business or profession, I
have none. I'm a drone."</p>

<p>"A drone, sir! I'm delighted," exclaimed
Mr. Pilgrim, with marked interest.
Then, "Hello, Marion. Back again."</p>

<p>Roker turned, and there, framed in the
doorway, was a living Romney picture&mdash;a
radiant girl.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>She came forward, the light playing on
her red-brown hair.</p>

<p>"Lord Roker&mdash;my daughter," said Mr.
Pilgrim.</p>

<p>The girl smiled and shook hands.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not interrupting a very
serious deliberation," she said, half hesitating.</p>

<p>"Indeed not," Lord Roker hastened to
assure her, fearful lest this delectable vision
should vanish.</p>

<p>She took the chair he offered.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you gotten at York?"
inquired Mr. Pilgrim.</p>

<p>"You'd neither of you guess. Three
grandfather's clocks."</p>

<p>"Three!" exclaimed Mr. Pilgrim. "Sheraton?"
he added.</p>

<p>"No; just grandfather's clocks, and the
dearest ones you ever saw."</p>

<p>"I could bet on that," said her father.
"Are they genuine?"</p>

<p>"They are all dated, and Mr. Tullitt got
pedigrees with each of them. One of them
tells the moon, and one the day of the month.
We shall have to hire an astrologer to regulate
them and start them fair. Mr. Tullitt
says he works best on board your railroad
car, as noise suits him, so I shall fix the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
clocks up in his den here to keep him happy.
I reckon he'll know when it's lunch time,
anyway. But what have you been doing,
dad?"</p>

<p>"Makin' a few notes. At present I'm
gettin' some valu'ble information. Lord
Roker says he's a drone."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sure that Lord Roker does
himself an injustice," she said, turning her
smiling eyes upon him.</p>

<p>Roker shook his head.</p>

<p>"I toil not, neither do I spin."</p>

<p>"What do you do all the time?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I shoot and fish and hunt, and&mdash;er&mdash;once
a year I see the Eton and Harrow
cricket match."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed Mr. Pilgrim. "He
shoots and fishes and hunts, and once a
year he goes to a cricket match."</p>

<p>"I said the Eton and Harrow match."</p>

<p>"Cert'nly. They must give it some
name, I reckon. An' what do you do when
you can't shoot, an' fish, an' hunt?"</p>

<p>"I add up my lists of kills and catches."</p>

<p>"This is downright interestin'," said
Mr. Pilgrim. "What do you shoot an'
hunt?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Birds and foxes."</p>

<p>"You seem to fancy small fry, sir. Did
you never hanker after elephants?"</p>

<p>"Never. If I had a Maxim or a Gatling
gun I might turn my attention to elephants,
but I'm not going to buy one for the purpose."</p>

<p>Mr. Pilgrim looked hard at his guest, but
Lord Roker bore the scrutiny impassibly.</p>

<p>"May I ask how you get your dollars?"
the American continued.</p>

<p>"I have an income from my father. I
don't mind telling you the amount&mdash;three
thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Dollars?"</p>

<p>"No; pounds sterling."</p>

<p>"That's a tidy figure; but did you
never wanter make that three thousand into
thirty thousand?"</p>

<p>"I have suggested an increase to my
father, but not such a big one as that. I
asked him to make it five, but he would
not. Some day perhaps he may, but
thirty thousand is out of the question."</p>

<p>"I should suppose it was. I didn't mean
an increase in your allowance. Did you
never think of dippin' into trade, and increasin'
it that way?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Doesn't fancy elephants or trade," Mr.
Pilgrim soliloquised. "Well, I reckon it
takes all sorts of swallows to make a summer.
Your father must have been in a good way
of business."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. He inherited all he
has from his ancestors."</p>

<p>"And how did the original ancestor make
his pile?"</p>

<p>"In war, in the time of Edward III.
He had the good fortune to capture a Royal
Prince, two dukes, and a marshal of France.
We are still living on the ransoms he got."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have known the original
ancestor," said Mr. Pilgrim. "Reckon he'd
have tackled elephants if he'd only got a
pea-shooter."</p>

<p>"Father," broke in Miss Pilgrim, "I'm
sure Lord Roker is tired of answering questions.
Don't you think it's our turn to do
something now?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Mr. Pilgrim, who long
since had forgotten his unkind suspicions
of his visitor's intentions. "I hope I haven't
worried you too much, my lord. It isn't
every day that I get the chance of interviewin'
a future hereditary legislator. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
promised last night to show you some historical
curiosities. We'll just go an' rout
out my secretary, Tullitt, who has the
keepin' of 'em."</p>

<p>They adjourned to the next room, and
found Mr. Tullitt busy at his desk. He
opened various cabinets and drawers for
them.</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Pilgrim, "is the original
warrant signed by Henry VIII., consignin'
his sixth wife to the Tower of London for
beheadin' purposes. He had it penned in
Latin to frighten her more. The writ was
never served, as Henry changed his mind,
an' decided to keep her on the throne.</p>

<p>"Here, sir, is my last purchase&mdash;thirty
pages of 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' written
by John Bunyan in Bedford Jail. I paid
ten thousand dollars for that, an' I'd have
paid twenty before missin' it. You see, my
name is John Pilgrim, an' it seemed to me
that I have a sort of claim on that book&mdash;a
kind of relationship. Anyway, there's my
two names on the title-page.</p>

<p>"Moreover, I've got on so well since I
started life in a Chicago stock-yard that
'Pilgrim's Progress' would best describe my
record. If it wasn't irreverent, I'd have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
called the autobiography I'm writin' by the
name of that book; but as I can't do so,
I've bought the original manuscript. You'll
handle it carefully; it's not in first-rate
repair."</p>

<p>Mr. Pilgrim showed his guest other historical
treasures, and would have gone on
indefinitely had not his daughter compassionately
intervened. The rest of the evening
was spent in conversation, and in listening
to coon songs witchingly sung by Miss
Pilgrim to her accompaniment on a harpsichord,
once the property of Mrs. Thrale of
Streatham, a friend of the immortal Dr.
Johnson.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my lord," said Mr. Pilgrim
at eleven o'clock. "P'raps you'll be kind
enough to look round in the mornin'. I
shall make a few notes of the information
you've given me, and my secretary will lick
them into shape."</p>

<p>"Right," said Lord Roker, with his eyes
beyond Mr. Pilgrim, fixed on an enchanting
vision of brown and gold, seated in the
basket chair before the fire.</p>

<p>On the following morning Lord Roker
found Mr. Pilgrim's secretary before a typewriter
which he seemed to be working against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
time. A pile of correspondence lay around
him. He finished the sheet on which he was
engaged, and then, with a sigh of relief, he
turned to his visitor.</p>

<p>"Mornin', my lord; I have this ready
for you."</p>

<p>He handed a type-written sheet to Lord
Roker, who sat down and read:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Some day I may be an hereditary legislator.
At present I'm a drone. I fish, shoot birds, and
hunt foxes, and once a year I attend a cricket
match. Birds are more suited to the bore of my
gun than elephants. If I had a Maxim I might
tackle elephants. I am in receipt of an income
of three thousand pounds sterling a year from my
father, who refuses to increase the amount. I
am otherwise well satisfied with the universe.</p>

<p>"My record last year was:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Hunting and fishing record">
<tr><td align="left">Birds..................</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Fishes.................</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Foxes ................."</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div>

<p>"I've left space for the mortality returns,
and any note you may wish to add," said
the secretary courteously. "Kindly fill in
the figures, and initial the sheet if you find
it correct. Your name will not appear if
Mr. Pilgrim makes use of the information."</p>

<p>Lord Roker referred to his pocket-book
for statistics, and then inserted the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
required. The note he added was: "<i>De
mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i>"</p>

<p>"Good kills, all of 'em," he explained.</p>

<p>The secretary took the sheet and placed
it methodically in a folio labelled "Britishers."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Pilgrim anywhere about?" Lord
Roker asked. "Or Miss Pilgrim?"</p>

<p>"I believe that Miss Pilgrim is in the
grounds, but Mr. Pilgrim has gone across
the moors in his motor to shed a tear at
the residence of the late Charlotte Brontë.
A wonderful man is the boss, my lord. It
takes me all my time to file the information
he gathers. It will be midnight before I
have fixed Charlotte up."</p>

<p>"Your hours are long," said Lord Roker,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"They are; and they are getting longer.
Your country is just waking up to the fact
that John Pilgrim is here. We had a big
mail to-day. Outside proper business there
were twenty begging letters from tramps
and prodigals, eighteen asking for subscriptions,
and two which we could not decipher.
Four town councils mixed us up with Andrew
Carnegie and wrote demanding Free Libraries.
I reply to them all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I won't trespass any longer on
your time."</p>

<p>Mr. Tullitt pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"Snakes!" he exclaimed. "I always
have fifteen minutes' dumb-bell exercise now
to keep me in form. Good-mornin', my lord."
His visitor left him standing in position with
his dumb-bells.</p>

<p>Now when Lord Roker turned in his
chair and first saw Miss Marion Pilgrim he
was confounded. When she spoke&mdash;and to
her beauty there was added an infinite
charm of frankness and joy of life&mdash;he fell
hopelessly in love. Only once before had
this happened to him, and, singularly
enough, she also was an American&mdash;a dark-eyed
Boston girl he met in Rome. He had
been refused because his position and his
prospects rendered the match an impossibility&mdash;to
her father; for he was not at that time
heir to an earldom. Since then he had gone
unscathed through the perils of many
seasons in many capitals, only to be finally
routed while in pursuit of the commonplace
profession of a burglar.</p>

<p>That he had aroused any interest in her
heart he did not for a moment suppose,
but perhaps there might be a remote chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of winning her. If there were, how could
he imperil his hope of success by running
the risks attendant on the burglary? If she
could give him the slightest hope he would
resign his membership of the Burglars' forthwith.
It was ridiculous to have to rush
matters, but he had to know his fate at once.
He could not even put it off till to-morrow,
for he knew she was going to Knaresborough
for the day with her father.</p>

<p>He met her on the golf links. They
played in a foursome in the morning. In the
afternoon they had a round together.</p>

<p>She was in capital form. Her splendid
health and energy were a delight to the eye.
Perhaps it was owing to this distraction
that he foozled some of his drives, and
twice got badly bunkered. His play went
steadily from bad to worse, and she won
by three up and two to play.</p>

<p>"I don't think you were playing your
best game," she said as they returned. "It
strikes me that you were thinking about
something else all the time."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. I never played
worse, and I was thinking about something
else."</p>

<p>"Something very serious, I reckon."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Is it anything I could help you in?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Miss Pilgrim. All
day, and most of last night, I have been
deliberating on an important step."</p>

<p>"What sort of a step?"</p>

<p>"Whether I ought not to resign my
membership of a certain club."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"You see, I was one of the founders,
and I like it. But sometimes the conditions
of membership seem impossible. At any
rate, I have felt them so since last evening."</p>

<p>"What are the conditions?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you them all, but one is
that you have to be a bachelor&mdash;a confirmed
bachelor."</p>

<p>"Well, you are one, aren't you?" she
asked gently.</p>

<p>"I don't know. At any rate, I may not
always be. In fact, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you be in a hurry to change,"
said Miss Pilgrim. "Don't imitate that king
of yours. Judging from the document dad
showed you, Henry the Eighth wanted to
be a bachelor again, and then decided to
remain a married man, all in one day. You
Britishers are so variable."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may seem very absurd, Miss Pilgrim,
but I have to make up my mind without
delay. And you can help me in the matter.
May I&mdash;dare I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One minute, Lord Roker," she interrupted
quickly. "You ought to be very
careful before you think of changing your
state. Teddy Robson waited twelve months
before I promised to marry him."</p>

<p>"Teddy Robson!" exclaimed Lord Roker.</p>

<p>"Yes; this is his picture." She pulled
a locket from her dress, and showed him
the miniature of a nice, clean-looking lad.
"He's the son of Josh. K. Robson, the
Fustic King," she explained.</p>

<p>"Fustic?" repeated Lord Roker, with
intense gloom.</p>

<p>"It's a wood that dyes yellow. Dad is
the Logwood King, you know. Logwood
dyes black. When I marry Teddy, the two
firms will amalgamate, and we shall pretty
well control the output of the West Indies."</p>

<p>"I see," said Lord Roker; "or, rather,
I hear."</p>

<p>"That'll be in the fall. If ever you come
over to the States mind you look us up.
Teddy will give you some big game shooting.
I guess you like it, whatever you told dad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
You've done things. Mrs. Stilton told me
at breakfast this morning that you had got
a decoration for distinguishing yourself in
action."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was years ago."</p>

<p>"Not more than a hundred," she said
gravely. "And I reckon you don't let the
flies settle much. Gracious! but it's six
o'clock, and I've letters to mail. I must run.
But don't you be in a hurry about retiring
from that club."</p>

<p>"That's the second," said Lord Roker
enigmatically, as he watched her vanish,
"the second&mdash;and the last."</p>

<p>Lord Roker made no attempt to purloin
the Bunyan MS. that night. He thought
it possible that the indefatigable Mr. Tullitt
might prolong his labours on Charlotte Brontë
into the early hours of the morning, and,
being of a thoughtful temperament, he was
unwilling to interrupt them. He had still
two nights at his disposal. The next day he
spent chiefly on the links. He did not allow
his thoughts to linger regretfully on his hopeless
love. He gave his whole attention to
the game, and retrieved his reputation by
beating the professional's record. In the
evening he played his part in progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bridge with marked success: and then at
1.30 a.m., when the whole establishment was
presumably fast asleep, he descended from
his bedroom window by a stout rope, and
made his way to the wing occupied by
Mr. Pilgrim. He found the window of Mr.
Tullitt's room, and was busily engaged for
the next half-hour in opening it.</p>

<p>He then dropped into the room, and
turned on his light.</p>

<p>Three grandfather's clocks were solemnly
ticking in three separate corners. The fire
was still flickering in the grate. A pile of
letters, addressed and stamped, was ready
for the post. A batch of correspondence was
docketed and endorsed. The waste-paper
basket was full to overflowing.</p>

<p>Lord Roker gave one glance round, and
then tried the door. It was, as he expected,
locked on the outside. He placed some
chairs and other obstacles in front of it to
impede progress should an alarm be raised,
and lit the gas in order to add to Mr. Tullitt's
reputation for over-work. Then he turned
to the drawer in which the Bunyan MS. was
kept. It was locked. He produced a bundle
of keys, and finally opened it. There was
a document inside, but instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
time-stained, foxed, and torn, it was modern
and neat. Moreover, it was type-written,
and endorsed, "Notes on the late C. Brontë,
Haworth, Eng., 1904."</p>

<p>Lord Roker turned this out in disgust,
hoping to find the Bunyan MS. below; but
he was disappointed. The manuscript was
not there.</p>

<p>He replaced the Notes in the drawer and
turned his attention elsewhere. He opened
every drawer and portfolio, looked on every
shelf and in every corner, but in vain. There
was no sign of the Bunyan MS.</p>

<p>Determined not to be baffled&mdash;for his
credit as a burglar was at stake&mdash;Lord
Roker resumed his search, and again went
over the ground. Three times at least was
he disturbed&mdash;when the grandfather's clocks
went off at the hour and the half-hour with
alarming wheezes and groans. When they
had finished with 3.30 he had to admit
himself beaten. The manuscript had no
doubt been removed to another room. It
was desperately annoying, but he had still
twenty-four hours to find out where it was,
and to get it. He gave up the search
reluctantly, made his way through the
window, and up the rope to his bedroom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after breakfast that morning word
went round the Hydro that the Bunyan
MS. had been stolen from Mr. Pilgrim's
rooms&mdash;the manuscript for which he had
just paid £2,000.</p>

<p>A hole cut in one of the window-panes
pointed to the method by which entry had
been made, but no clue to the thief had
been left behind. The police had been informed,
and a detective was coming.</p>

<p>Only the Bunyan MS. was missing&mdash;that
alone of the many portable and valuable
treasures in Mr. Pilgrim's possession. It
showed a literary instinct in the thief
which was as surprising as it was unusual,
for it would be impossible for him to make
any profitable use of his booty without
certain discovery. The more one reflected
about it the more perplexing it was.</p>

<p>To Lord Roker it was humiliating in the
extreme. To fail in his mission was exasperating;
but the annoyance was increased tenfold
with the knowledge that he had been
forestalled. Someone else&mdash;a professional, no
doubt&mdash;had been on the same errand. He
had not dallied over the enterprise, and he
had won the stakes for which he played,
and now he, Lord Roker, would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
appear empty-handed at the Burglars'&mdash;he,
a founder of the Club, would be the first
man who had to resign through incapacity
to carry out the terms of his membership;
it was galling indeed. Even the neat hole
he had made in the window had been placed
to the credit of the other burglar.</p>

<p>At 6 p.m. he went upstairs to dress. The
evenings were chilly, and he occasionally had
a fire. He sat down before it now to finish
his cigarette, and moodily watched the flames
while his thoughts turned on the unsatisfactory
nature of all earthly affairs.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave an exclamation of extreme
surprise, jumped out of his chair,
and caught hold of a bit of half-burnt paper
projecting from the grate. It was perhaps
three inches long, and two across. Half of
it was ash that fell away as he touched it.
On the scant margin left was written, in
stiff, archaic English, "Ye Slough of
Desp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Amazing!" he cried. For the fragment
he held in his hand was part of the
missing MS.!</p>

<p>In another instant he had seized his
water-jug and emptied the contents on the
fire, putting it out, and deluging the hearth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Then he rang the bell, and sent an urgent
message for Mr. Pilgrim.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the American entered.
Roker handed him the fragment, and pointed
out where he had found it.</p>

<p>"Seems a pretty expensive way of li'tin'
fires," said Mr. Pilgrim, grimly. "Allow me
to ring for the help."</p>

<p>"Did you lay this fire?" he asked the
maid who responded.</p>

<p>"No, sir. That's Jenny's work."</p>

<p>"Send Jenny up, then," said Mr. Pilgrim,
now on his knees searching the grate for
more traces of the MS., but searching in vain.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jenny entered.</p>

<p>"Did you lay this fire?" Mr. Pilgrim
asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What sort of paper did you use for it?"</p>

<p>"Newspaper. Oh, I know! I laid it
yesterday morning with some old rubbishy
stuff I found on your floor, sir."</p>

<p>"Old rubbishy stuff you found on my
floor!" cried Mr. Pilgrim. "What do you
mean, girl?"</p>

<p>"I was lighting your fire yesterday
morning, sir, and found I'd used up all my
paper, so I got some out of your waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
basket. There was a dirty lot of rubbishy
paper lying on the floor beside it, so I took
that as well, and used it up for my morning
fires."</p>

<p>"How many fires did you lay with it
altogether?"</p>

<p>"Your two, sir, this one, and the one in
the hall."</p>

<p>"Then this is the only one of the lot
that wasn't lit yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I hope it wasn't anythink
important that I used."</p>

<p>Mr. Pilgrim sat down.</p>

<p>"Important! Not a bit, my girl. It
just cost me ten thousand dollars&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"It wasn't what they say you've lost,
sir, was it?" said the girl. "Oh, sir, I'm
that sorry. But all I can say, sir, is that
it was on the floor, and it didn't look fit
for wrapping sossingers in."</p>

<p>"Go!" shouted Mr. Pilgrim. "You're
a born fool." Then, after a long pause, he
added, "I'm much obliged to you, Roker.
Now come along. I must see my secretary.
I suspect he's another mortal fool in disguise."</p>

<p>Mr. Pilgrim's secretary was busy, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
usual&mdash;this time taking down a letter from
Miss Pilgrim's dictation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="396" height="500" alt="Four people looking out of a window
" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HEY! BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT HOLE IN THE WINDOW?&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_135">p. 135.</a></i>)</div>
</div>


<p>"Excuse me a minute, Marion," said Mr.
Pilgrim. Then to his secretary, "You said
you were readin' that blamed Bunyan MS.
the night before last. Just describe when
you got it out, and what followed."</p>

<p>"I'd finished my transcript of your notes
on Miss Brontë, sir, about 11.30, and, having
half an hour to spare, I thought I'd just
run over that old manuscript again. John
Bunyan had his own notions about caligraphy,
and he was a bit freer in his spelling
than any man I'd come across, so I rather
fancied him. While I was reading, you
may remember calling me to your room to
take down that cable to Boston and the
letter of confirmation. It was 12.30 when
I left you, and I'd clean forgotten about
the manuscript. I turned the light out, and
went to bed. A quarter of an hour afterwards
I remembered I'd left Bunyan out,
so I came back here. I couldn't find the
matches, but just felt round for the MS.,
and put it back in the drawer, and locked it."</p>

<p>"You derned hayseed!" burst in Mr.
Pilgrim. "You have your p'ints, but at
this pertic'ler moment I think you're more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
suited for raisin' cabbages than for secretary
work. If you can't tell the difference in the
handle of a Bunyan MS. and your notes
on Charlotte Brontë in the dark, you might
know a banana from a potato in daylight.
You're&mdash;you're&mdash;&mdash; Man, you put the
Brontë notes in the drawer, and left Bunyan
out&mdash;brushed him on the floor in the dark,
an' the help lit the fire with him. Gor!"</p>

<p>The secretary collapsed.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mr. Tullitt," said Miss
Pilgrim. "It was entirely a mistake. I
might have done it myself. It comes of
working so late. Dad, I guess there's plenty
more old manuscripts in the British Isles
waiting for dollars to fetch them."</p>

<p>"I reckon there's only one Bunyan MS.,"
said Mr. Pilgrim, solemnly, "and that's gone
to light Hydropathic fires because my secretary
doesn't carry wax vestas in his pyjamas.
Hey! But what about that hole in the
window?"</p>

<p>Mr. and Miss Pilgrim, the secretary, and
Lord Roker stared blankly at it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And that is why Lord Roker was not
able to show the Bunyan MS. at the next
meeting of the Burglars' Club.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GREAT SEAL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hon. Richard Hilton stared at the
type-written letter with distinct feelings of
pleasure. This is what he read:&mdash;</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you of your
election as a member of the Club, conditional upon
your attendance on the 5th proximo with the Great
Seal of the United Kingdom, procured in the
usual way.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">The Hon. Secretary.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"That's good," he ejaculated. "Ribston's
a trump. But what on earth's the
Great Seal of the United Kingdom, and
where is it to be found?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton's library was chiefly devoted
to sport and fiction, and he could find no
reference to it therein. He had therefore
to make inquiries outside, when he learnt
that the Great Seal of the United Kingdom
was the property of the Lord Chancellor
for the time being, that it was a very important
object indeed, its impression being
requisite at the foot of the highest documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of State; and, consequently, that its
unexpected absence might very well upset
the nation's affairs and incidentally bring
serious trouble upon anyone who had tampered
with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton's sporting instincts were roused.
"It seems to me," he thought, "that this
is going to be the best thing I have had on
since I walked across Thibet disguised as
a second-class Mahatma. But where does
the Chancellor keep the thing?"</p>

<p>He skimmed through many biographies
of Lord Chancellors with very little result.
One of them, it appeared, kept the Great
Seal with his silver, another always carried
it about with him in a special pocket, and
slept with it under his pillow; while a third
stored it at the Bank of England. History
was discreetly silent as to how the other
hundred and one keepers of the Great Seal
guarded their property.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Hilton contemplated his
notes with disgust. "I never could rely
on books," he said. "There's nothing for
it but to find out for myself. The present
man probably keeps it where any other
common-sense fellow would. He'll have a
library, so it may be there. He's a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
liver, so it may be in a secret bin in his wine
cellar; he's a sportsman, so it may be in a
gun-case under his bed. I shall have to
look round and find out. Where does he
live?"</p>

<p>His lordship's town residence was Shipley
House, Kensington Gore. Hilton took a
walk in that direction. The house looked as
unpromising and unsympathetic a subject for
robbery as a metropolitan magistrate could
have wished. The spiked railings in front
and the high wall at the back would have
suggested to most people the impossibility
of the enterprise; but Mr. Hilton simply
noted these items with interest, and then
adjourned to a light lunch at his club to
think the matter out.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock in the morning when
Mr. Hilton scaled the wall at the rear of the
Lord Chancellor's house. Though it was nine
feet high, it presented no difficulties to an
ex-lieutenant in the navy; but he got over
carefully, for he was in evening dress, believing
that to be the safest disguise for a
general burglar. He dropped lightly on the
turf, and then made his way across to the
house and commenced a careful inspection
of the basement windows. To his intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
surprise, he found the lower sash of one of
them to be open. This astonishing piece of
good luck meant the saving of at least an
hour. With a cheerful heart he entered the
house, finding his way by the electric flashlight
which he carried.</p>

<p>His passage to the great hall upstairs was
easy. Here he halted to take his bearings.
He was at the foot of the marble stairs for
which Shipley House was famous. Once they
had stood in front of Nero's villa at Antium;
but, oblivious of his historic surroundings,
Mr. Richard Hilton stood wondering which
of the four doors on his left led to the library.
One after another he cautiously opened them,
only to find living or reception rooms. He
crossed the hall, and got into the billiard-room.
Where on earth was the Lord Chancellor's
den? Ah! those heavy curtains
under the staircase. He passed through
them. There was a short passage, with a
door at the end. Hush! what was that?
He listened intently. It was nothing&mdash;merely
nervous fancy. He turned the handle of
the door, and entered.</p>

<p>He was in the Lord Chancellor's library.
But, Heavens! he was not there alone.</p>

<p>For a moment he drew back in dismay;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
but the singularity of the other man's
occupation arrested him.</p>

<p>He was kneeling on the floor before the
wall at the far end of the room. He had a
lamp or candle by his side. What on earth
was he doing? Had he surprised the Lord
High Chancellor, the keeper of the King of
England's conscience, worshipping by stealth
at some pagan shrine?</p>

<p>What were the rites he was performing?
Curiosity impelled Mr. Hilton forward. As
he drew nearer, the situation unfolded itself.
He had done the Lord Chancellor an injustice.
It was not he.</p>

<p>A man was kneeling before a safe built
into the wall. He was drilling holes into
the door by the light of a lamp.</p>

<p>He was a real burglar!</p>

<p>The humour of the situation struck Mr.
Hilton so keenly that he nearly laughed.
For some time he watched the operation,
expecting each moment to be discovered.
Then, as the man continued absorbed in his
work, Mr. Hilton sank noiselessly into an
easy chair behind him. To prepare for contingencies,
his hand had stolen to his coat
pocket, and now held a small revolver.</p>

<p>For half an hour longer he continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
admire the businesslike methods of the
burglar. The door of the safe had now been
pierced through all round the lock. The
man turned to reach another tool. In so
doing his eye caught sight of a patent leather
boot and a trouser leg, where before there
had been empty space. The phenomenon
fascinated him. He slowly turned his head,
following the clue upward until his eyes were
level with the barrel of Mr. Hilton's revolver.
His jaw fell, and he stiffened.</p>

<p>"Please keep as you are for a minute,"
said a low voice from behind the weapon.
"I wish you to understand the situation.
There is no immediate cause for anxiety. I
am&mdash;er&mdash;a friend in disguise. You may go
on with your most interesting work. I shall
give no alarm. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Who the blazes are you?" asked the
burglar.</p>

<p>"Your curiosity is natural. I am in your
own noble profession&mdash;a top-sawyer or a
swell mobsman, I forget which; but I have
the certificate at home."</p>

<p>"None of yer gammon," said the burglar.
"Can't you put that thing down an' say
wot yer game is."</p>

<p>"William," Mr. Hilton replied, "I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you clearly to understand that you have
nothing at all to do with my game. You go
on drilling those nice little holes. When
you've got that door open we'll discuss
matters further. Please proceed."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="475" height="389" alt="man in chair pointing gun at man in doorway" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;YOU MAY GO ON WITH YOUR MOST INTERESTING WORK.&#39;&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_141">p. 141.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"D'you take me for a mug?" asked the
burglar defiantly.</p>

<p>"I shall, if you don't go on with your
work. This instrument goes off on the
slightest provocation, and the wound it
makes is very painful."</p>

<p>The burglar turned, and resumed his
work; but he did not seem to have much
heart in it, nor to derive much encouragement
from Mr. Hilton's occasional promptings.
Every now and then he looked round
suspiciously. Another half-hour passed before
he had prized the bolts back, and the
door was open.</p>

<p>For the moment the two men forgot everything
but their curiosity, and both looked
anxiously inside. Every shelf and pigeon-hole
was rummaged, but there was nothing
but letters and documents. There were two
drawers below. The locks of these had to be
picked. In the last one the burglar pounced
on a bag of money and some notes.</p>

<p>"Got 'im!" he cried triumphantly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Two 'underd an' fifty quid. 'E gets
it on the fust of ev'ry month to pay 'is
washin' bill."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"From a pal at the bank. I've 'ad this
in my eye for a year or more, but I've mos'ly
been a-doin' time since I&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped
short suddenly, evidently regretting his outburst
of confidence.</p>

<p>"Now put that money back," said Mr.
Hilton.</p>

<p>"Wot for?"</p>

<p>"Because I tell you."</p>

<p>"Arfter all the trouble I've 'ad? No
bloomin' fear."</p>

<p>"Put it back. You shan't lose by it."</p>

<p>"Wot d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking for something myself. It
isn't in the safe, but it may be in some
other drawer in the room. If I find it I'll
give you £250 myself."</p>

<p>"Name o'Morgan, or am I speakin' to
Lord Rothschild?" said the burglar sarcastically.
"You don't 'appen to 'ave the
chink on you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't; but see, you can have this
watch and chain, and my sovereign purse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and these links, and I think&mdash;yes, here's a
tenner. You can have this lot till I give
you the money."</p>

<p>The burglar was impressed.</p>

<p>"Cap'n," he said, "you've a free an' easy
way in 'andlin' walubles wot soots me down
to the ground. I wish we could 'ave met
sooner. It would 'ave saved my ole woman
many a weary six months. But wot's the
need to leave the chink? S'pose we takes
the bag, an' leaves the notes?"</p>

<p>"You've got to leave the lot, William,"
said Mr. Hilton decisively.</p>

<p>The burglar turned thoughtfully away
from the safe. "Wot is it you're lookin'
for?" he asked. "'As the guv'n'r cut you
orf with a bob, an' are you a-goin' to alter
the ole bloke's will?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking for a seal."</p>

<p>"Stuffed?" asked William, with a sportsman's
interest.</p>

<p>"No. A seal for stamping wax. It's a
big one, made of silver, and about six inches
across. Let's try these drawers in the desk."</p>

<p>There were six of them. Four were open,
the other two locked. It took some time to
open these. They were full of legal matter.
Then they turned their attention to a set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
below some bookshelves. While the burglar
was busy with the locks Hilton turned over
the papers on the desk. The first was headed,
"House of Lords: Gibbins <i>v.</i> Gibbins. Judgment
of Lord Ravy." Another read, "Gibbins
<i>v.</i> Gibbins. Judgment of Lord McTaughtun."
Beside them was the half-written
judgment of the Lord Chancellor himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Hilton looked at these legal
feats without interest. Mechanically he lifted
the lid of the desk. A large leather case
fitted exactly into the compartment below.
He pulled it out. It was stamped with the
royal arms.</p>

<p>"Here. Cut this, please."</p>

<p>The flap was cut, and Hilton drew out a
richly embroidered and betasselled silk purse.</p>

<p>He looked eagerly inside.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he cried in his excitement.
For it was the Great Seal of the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The burglar examined it critically, and
then felt its weight. "Five quid," he said,
putting it down contemptuously.</p>

<p>Hilton dropped it carefully into his pocket.</p>

<p>At this moment the electric light was
suddenly switched on, and the whole place
was brilliantly illuminated. They both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
turned sharply towards the door. There in
his dressing-gown stood an old gentleman.
Hilton had often seen those classic features
in photographs or the illustrated papers.
He recognised them at once. It was the
Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" came the
stern judicial voice.</p>

<p>"We are&mdash;er&mdash;we are making the Home
Circuit, my lord," said Hilton deferentially.
"May I ask your lordship to be good enough
to lower your voice. You perceive that I
am armed."</p>

<p>"You would dare to fire on me, sir?"
said the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>"I hope it will not be necessary; for in
that case your lordship would not hunt next
season with the Bister Vale. Will you please
take that seat?"</p>

<p>His lordship sank into the chair. "You
are a bold man," he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>"A bold, bad man, I fear, my lord. And
so is my partner, Mr. William Sikes here.
Aren't you, William?"</p>

<p>William did not reply. He was gazing
intently at the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>"Ain't yer name 'Ardy?" he asked.
"'Enery 'Ardy?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"It used to be," replied his lordship.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Mr. Sikes. "Then
I says to yer face you're a bloomin', footlin'
rotter."</p>

<p>"'Gently, brother, gently, pray,'" said
Hilton.</p>

<p>"A bloomin', footlin' rotter," repeated
Mr. Sikes with the earnestness of conviction.
"An' I've waited five-an'-twenty year to
tell you so."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Lord Chancellor, with
some interest. "How is that?"</p>

<p>"I once paid you to defend me at the
Dawchester 'Sizes respectin' a mare wot 'ad
follered me inter 'Ampshire. A sickenin' 'ash
you made of it. You got two quid fer the
job, an' I got two year. I b'lieve you woz
boozed."</p>

<p>"Pray forgive William, my lord," said
Hilton. "He forgets himself strangely when
he's excited. We have a lot of trouble with
him at home."</p>

<p>William glared at him. "I ain't forgot
that bloke's ugly mug, any'ow. I swore I'd
be quits with 'im one day, an', holy Moses,
it's my go now." Saying this, he clutched
his jemmy, and advanced threateningly towards
his lordship.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stay, you fool!" Hilton cried. "If you
dare to touch him I'll shoot you. Get back."</p>

<p>William hesitated.</p>

<p>"If you don't get back before I count
three I'll lame you for life. One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>William retired sullenly.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Hilton, "I must draw
this painful interview to a close. Your
presence excites William, and he's always
dangerous when excited. We will retire.
Before I go, I wish to give you my word
of honour that anything we may take away
with us to-night will be again in your
possession within forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"Your word of honour, sir!" repeated
his lordship with withering contempt.</p>

<p>"You are ungenerous, my lord. You
force me to remind you that but for my
interference William would undoubtedly have
had his revenge upon you to-night, and the
Woolsack have lost its brightest ornament.
In return, I ask your lordship to give me
your own assurance that you will not raise
any alarm for the next half-hour. If you
do not we shall have to bind and gag you."</p>

<p>"Don't you be such a fool as to trust
'im," said William. "I'll do the gaggin',"
he added, with enthusiasm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut up, William," said Mr. Hilton.
"If his lordship gives his word you may
be sure he will keep it&mdash;even with thieves.
The age of chivalry is not yet past, although
you are still alive. My lord, do you agree?"</p>

<p>"I am in your hands. I promise."</p>

<p>Hilton bowed. He pointed to the door
to his companion.</p>

<p>"My tools," said William, going round
the desk to collect them. A minute later
the two had left the room. In five minutes
they had scaled the outside wall, and within
the half-hour were in Richard Hilton's rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. William Sikes looked round him
admiringly.</p>

<p>"I understand your feelings, William,"
said Mr. Hilton, "but my windows and
doors are every night connected with a
burglar-alarm, and my man, who was once
a noted bruiser, is close at hand. I don't
really think it would be safe for you to call
again. Now you want your money. I will
write a cheque out, payable to bearer, and
give it you. If you make yourself nice and
tidy they will cash it for you in the morning
over the counter at my bank."</p>

<p>"I don't like cashin' cheques at banks,"
said William. "I never was any good at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it," he added pensively. "Ain't you got
any rhino in this 'ere shanty?"</p>

<p>"Let me see. You have a tenner of
mine in your pocket. Perhaps I can give
you some more." Hilton opened a bureau,
and produced a cash-box. "You see where
I keep it, William," he remarked pleasantly.
"I shall have to find another place for it
in future&mdash;you are so very impulsive. Ah,
here we are. Three fivers and two&mdash;four&mdash;six
in gold. That makes twenty-one. And
where's the sovereign purse I gave you?
Thank you. Here are four more: that
makes twenty-five; and you have ten: that
is thirty-five. Now I'll make a cheque out
for the balance&mdash;what is it? Yes; two
hundred and fifteen pounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here it is.
Perhaps your friend at the Lord Chancellor's
bank will present it for you before three
o'clock this afternoon, when I shall suddenly
find that I have lost the cheque, and shall
stop payment."</p>

<p>"Wot do you do that for?" asked
William suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I must do it for my own protection,
William, as I'm afraid it wouldn't be wise
for me to have any direct transactions with
you. But until three o'clock the game is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in your hands. Now it's time for you to
have your beauty sleep. I am much obliged
for your assistance. Good-night. Oh, by
the way, let me have my watch, please&mdash;and
the links. William, I'm afraid you were
forgetting them."</p>

<p>"Blow me, but I was," said William
frankly, as he dived into his capacious
pockets. "My mem'ry ain't wot it used
to be, an' I knows it. Wot with work an'
worry, an' worry an' work, it don't 'ave a
fair chance. 'Ere you are, Cap'n." And
William placed the jewellery in Mr. Hilton's
hands with obvious regret. Then his host
showed him off the premises.</p>

<p>It was now four o'clock. Hilton pulled
out the Great Seal, and locked it up in a
secret drawer in his bureau. Then he retired
to rest, in the happy consciousness of a night
well spent.</p>

<p>He rose late that morning, and it was one
o'clock before he left his rooms. In Piccadilly,
on the news posters:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class='small'>THE</span><br />
GREAT SEAL<br />
<span class='small'>OF</span><br />
ENGLAND<br />
STOLEN,"<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>at once caught his eye. He bought a paper,
and turned to the column with curious
interest.</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"A daring robbery was perpetrated in the early
hours of this morning at Shipley House, Kensington
Gore, the residence of the Lord Chancellor.
His lordship, being unable to sleep, came downstairs
about two o'clock, intending to complete an
important judgment. In the library he found two
burglars, who succeeded in decamping before his
lordship could obtain assistance.</p>

<p>"The Great Seal of England, and £250 in gold
and notes are missing.</p>

<p>"This is probably the most audacious burglary
of modern times, for the Lord Chancellor is the
head of the judicial system of the country, and,
after Royalty, is only second in importance to the
Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>"England is to-day without a Great Seal of
State, a position unparalleled since it was stolen
from Lord Thurlow's residence in 1784. Only once
before had it been missing&mdash;when James II. threw
it into the Thames at Lambeth.</p>

<p>"Great inconvenience has already been caused
by its absence, as the treaty between England
and Korea was to have been signed to-morrow,
and the Great Seal affixed thereto. We understand
that the Privy Council will meet in the morning
at Buckingham Palace in order to deal with the
situation thus created.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are informed that the police have an
important clue which will lead to the apprehension
of at least one of the criminals. We do not know
whether any special penalty is attached to the
theft of the Great Seal, but a century ago the perpetrator
of the crime would undoubtedly have been
hanged."</p></div>

<p>Richard Hilton stared at this in blank
amazement. The pains and penalties did
not disturb him, but "£250 in gold and notes
missing" held him spellbound. Suddenly
light dawned upon him, and he burst out
with "Done! And by William! That was
when he collected his tools, and I wasn't
watching. The scoundrel! Hi! hansom!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Cox's Bank. Sharp!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was at the bank
counter.</p>

<p>"I have lost a cheque for £215, payable
to bearer, made out to self and endorsed.
Please stop payment," he said.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, Mr. Hilton," replied the
teller. "It was presented first thing this
morning, and I cashed it in gold."</p>

<p>That evening the meeting of the Burglars'
Club was held at the house of Lord Altamont,
an ex-colonel of the Welsh Guards. There
was a record attendance. The robbery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Great Seal had excited general interest,
but to members of the Club the accompanying
details were of the gravest importance.</p>

<p>After the usual opening formalities had
been gone through, Lord Ribston rose.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, I crave leave for Mr.
Richard Hilton, a cadet member of this
club, to speak."</p>

<p>Assent was given by the general silence,
which was maintained when Hilton entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, my lords and gentlemen,"
he began, "I regret exceedingly that
I have to make my first appearance in your
midst with an apology. I take it that you
have all seen the paragraph in the papers
stating that the Great Seal is missing from
the Lord Chancellor's House, and, in addition
to that, £250 in notes and gold. No explanation
is needed as to the absence of
the Great Seal, for that resulted from the
mandate of your club. The other item calls
for a clear and explicit statement of the
facts of the case."</p>

<p>Here Hilton gave an account of the
robbery from his first meeting the burglar
to his parting from him, concluding, "So
now, gentlemen, I suggest that I deserve
your sympathy rather than your blame;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for not only has Mr. Sikes relieved me of
£250, but I have promised the Lord Chancellor
to return anything we took away with
us. I shall, therefore, have to send him a
further like sum. I do not grudge the loss
of £500, since I have been enabled to qualify
as a member of your club, but I do most
sincerely regret that my bungling has led
to even a temporary suspicion that the
taint of professionalism has been brought
into your midst. My lords and gentlemen,
I am in your hands. Here, at any rate, is
the Great Seal of the United Kingdom."</p>

<p>The last words were lost in tumultuous
applause. Each member rose to his feet
and acclaimed the speaker, and then they
crowded round him and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the President, when
order had been restored, "I move that Mr.
Richard Hilton be now formally enrolled as
a member of the Club, and in your name I
welcome him as one who has already added
lustre to our annals. The circumstances of
his entry are so unusual that, as a mark of
our appreciation, I beg to move that the
provincial line due from him in the usual
course of things in two years' time be hereby
excused, and that, as an exception to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
rule, Mr. Hilton be elected for a term of
four years."</p>

<p>The proposition was carried by acclamation.</p>

<p>"Your Grace and gentlemen, I thank
you," said the beaming Richard Hilton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Privy Council met at ten on the
following morning, and ordered a new seal
to be engraved; but at noon a postal packet
was delivered at Shipley House, which, on
being opened, disclosed an old biscuit tin,
then tissue paper, then cotton-wool, and
finally the Great Seal of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The treaty between England and Korea
was signed with the usual formalities at
three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Later in the day the Lord Chancellor
received from five different quarters registered
parcels, each weighing about a pound
avoirdupois. Each packet contained fifty
sovereigns.</p>

<p>Thus within forty-eight hours his lordship
had received all the stolen property.
In consideration thereof he cancelled his
instructions to Scotland Yard to follow up
a clue which Mr. William Sikes had incautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
given about a Dorset horse robbery
in the late 'seventies.</p>

<p>His lordship also advertised his acknowledgments
in the agony column of the <i>Times</i>,
and asked for the favour of an explanation
of the whole incident. This was not forthcoming,
and the matter remained for some
time the one unsolved riddle of his lordship's
life.</p>

<p>Mr. William Sikes, with the £500 so
ingeniously obtained, retired from the burglary
profession, and bought a little public
house known as the "Goat and Compasses."
For some reason or other he altered the name
to "Seal and Compasses," thereby causing
much mystification to future antiquarians in
that particular district.</p>

<p>In recalling his conduct on the night in
question, Mr. Sikes spends some of the
happiest hours of his life.</p>

<p>To Mr. Richard Hilton the events of that
night were also eminently satisfactory. He
was the only loser, but he had gained more
than he had lost, for the laurels of the
Burglars' Club were his.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>




<h2>VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LION AND THE SUN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> visit of His Royal Highness Ali Azim
Mirza, nephew of the Shah, accompanied by
the Grand Vizier, Hasan Kuli, is fresh in our
memories. The mission of the Prince was
to invest a distinguished personage with the
insignia of the Lion and the Sun in order
to mark the Persian monarch's appreciation
of the Garter which had been recently conferred
upon him. The Mission duly returned
with its object accomplished. Outwardly
everything happened as was anticipated, and
there are but few who know how nearly we
approached to a war with Russia as a consequence
of the visit, while still fewer are
aware that such a calamity was averted by
a cadet member of the Burglars' Club.</p>

<p>In the unwritten annals of the Club the
incident stands out prominently. It is well
that it should be recorded before it is forgotten.</p>

<p>The special Mission was due to arrive in
London on the 10th of the month. It was
to leave on the 16th. Lord Denton had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
placed his town house at the disposal of the
Prince and his retinue during their stay.</p>

<p>On the 4th, Mr. Birket Rivers, a cadet
member of the Burglars' Club, received an
intimation that his entrance fee could be
paid on the 13th by the production of the
insignia of the Order which the Prince was
bringing with him.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 8th, John Parker,
a footman in the employ of Lord Denton,
called by request on Mr. Rivers at his rooms
in the Albany.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Parker, how are you getting on?"</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You are going to have great times,
Parker. When does Lord Denton leave?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, sir."</p>

<p>"Are all the servants staying behind?"</p>

<p>"Only about half of us, sir. The Persians
bring their own cooks and men."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Are you remaining?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. I want you to let me take your
place."</p>

<p>Parker opened his eyes very wide. "Beg
pardon, sir," he said, feeling sure he had
misunderstood the last remark.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to take your place as footman
in Denton House while the Persians are
there. If you will help me to do so, Parker,
there's ten pounds for you."</p>

<p>Parker scratched his head. "I should
like the ten pounds, sir; but I don't see how
I'm to get it. They'd never mistake you
for me, sir, though we are about the same
build. Mr. Bradshaw would spot the difference
at once."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Bradshaw?"</p>

<p>"The butler, sir. He's pretty well left
in charge of the house."</p>

<p>"Listen, Parker. The Prince comes the
day after to-morrow. At eleven o'clock in
the morning of that day you've got to be
taken ill. Tell Bradshaw you can't work,
and you think it's something infectious.
Tell him that your cousin, James Finny,
who is only staying on with me till he hears
of a place, would jump at the job. Send
me word, and I will turn up at once."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw might know you, sir."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I've never been at
the house. Besides, I shall shave off my
moustache. Anyway, Parker, I'll take care
you lose nothing by it, even if I should be
found out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>John Parker left a quarter of an hour
later, ten pounds richer than he came. In his
pocket he carried a letter which eventually
reached Mr. Rivers by special messenger at
noon on the 10th. It ran:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p><span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,&mdash;Come immediately. I am ill,
and Mr. Bradshaw says you can take my place.&mdash;Your
loving cousin,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">John Parker</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>With his moustache shaved off, and
attired in a painfully respectable ready-made
suit, Rivers presented himself at Denton
House at one o'clock. He found Mr. Bradshaw
in a highly-wrought condition.</p>

<p>"So you're Parker's cousin? A pretty
mess he's landed me in!"</p>

<p>"I hope he's not very bad, sir."</p>

<p>"I hope he is. I hope he'll die," said
Mr. Bradshaw vengefully. "You've lived
with Mr. Rivers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you announce visitors?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Go to that door, and announce the Lord
Mayor."</p>

<p>Rivers&mdash;or, rather, James Finny&mdash;flung
open the door, and announced in stentorian
accents, "His Worship the Lord Mayor of
London."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"You hass!" shouted Mr. Bradshaw.
"You only worship him when you're in the
prisoners' box. I 'spect that's where you
met him. Call him 'his Lordship' when
he's a-wisitin'. Now again."</p>

<p>James obeyed.</p>

<p>"Bravo&mdash;that's better!" said another
voice. It proceeded from a mite of a man
who had approached noiselessly, and who
now stood rubbing his hands approvingly.
"But it's rather late for rehearsals, Mr.
Bradshaw, isn't it?" he added.</p>

<p>"Parker's taken ill," said Mr. Bradshaw
savagely. "He's sent this screw to take
his place."</p>

<p>"So thoughtful of Parker," murmured the
little man. "What's your name, and where
do you come from?" addressing the candidate
for office.</p>

<p>"James Finny, sir&mdash;from Mr. Birket
Rivers."</p>

<p>"Mr. Birket Rivers," reflected the other.
"Ah, to be sure&mdash;Mr. Birket Rivers, the
young millionaire. Drives a team of
spanking bays at the Four-in-Hand meets.
Attaché at Constantinople, or something.
Came into money and left the Service.
Wishes he'd stopped in it, I believe. A very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
active young gentleman. Oh, yes, I've heard of
your master&mdash;your late master, James Finny."</p>

<p>The little man was studying him intently
all the time. Then he fixed his eyes on
Rivers' hands. He lifted the right one,
looked at it, and passed on.</p>

<p>There was a loud ring, and a footman
entered with "Please, Mr. Bradshaw, there's
the gentlemen come from the hembassy."</p>

<p>The butler bustled to the door. "Go
up to Parker's room, and change into his
things at once, and then come down to me
in the 'all," he said to Rivers.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Rivers replied. "Beg pardon,
Mr. Bradshaw, who was that small gentleman
wot just left us?"</p>

<p>"That small gentleman," said Mr. Bradshaw,
with swelling dignity, "is Mr. Marvell,
from Scotland Yard; so you'd better be
careful, Finny."</p>

<p>Prince Ali Azim, accompanied by the
Vizier and a numerous suite, arrived that
afternoon, and the whole household was
thenceforth kept busy attending to the
wants, numerous and peculiar, of the Persians.
Rivers' chief duties were to attend to the
hall door, and to help to wait at meals.
He did his work to the satisfaction of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Bradshaw, and never a day passed without
Mr. Marvell, who was installed as the protecting
angel of the establishment, staring
fixedly at him, and then passing some word
of commendation in a tone that brought the
blood to his face.</p>

<p>"A shocking habit you have of blushing,
James Finny," the little man would say as
he toddled away.</p>

<p>And all the time the new footman was
trying to find out where the Order of the
Lion and the Sun was kept.</p>

<p>It was the 12th before he ascertained that
it was in one of three despatch boxes kept
in a bookcase in the library.</p>

<p>The Burglars' meeting took place on the
13th. He must purloin it before then&mdash;that
very night, if possible.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the Vizier was taken ill.</p>

<p>"Some of Parker's leavin's, I'll be
bound," said Mr. Bradshaw. "Same symtims.
Looks all right, and talks despairin'
of pains an' shivers. Won't have a doctor,
neither. If the Wizzer pipes out, Finny,
your preshus cousin'll be responsible."</p>

<p>At 8 p.m. the Prince and his suite, with
the exception of the invalid Vizier, set out
for the Alhambra and supper at the Carlton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Mr. Marvell, as usual, followed closely in
their wake.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock James Finny was off
duty. "Now or never," he thought. He
watched his opportunity, and then, unperceived,
entered the library, and there hid
himself behind a curtain, intending to wait
till the household was asleep, and then to
open the despatch box from his bunch of
skeleton keys. He had been there perhaps
half an hour when the door opened, and, to
his amazement, the Vizier entered. He was
followed by a servant bringing coffee and
cigarettes. There were cups for two.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly. The Vizier
looked impatiently at the clock, then strode
up to one of the windows, pulled back the
heavy curtain, raised the blind, and looked
out. Rivers' pulses quickened. What if
the Vizier were to come to his window?</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the Persian, replacing
the curtain, and resuming his seat.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a bemuffled object
made its appearance. The Vizier rose. The
servant withdrew, and the object emerged
from its wraps. Rivers knew the man at
once. He had met him at Constantinople.
It was Count Moranoff.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vizier bowed.</p>

<p>The newcomer responded, and then gave
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"<i>Peste!</i> but it was warm, Vizier," he
said. "I am delighted at last to have the
honour and the supreme pleasure of meeting
you."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," replied the Vizier,
"the fame of Count Moranoff has for long
inspired me with an intense wish that we
should meet. Allah has at last granted the
desire of my life. Will your Excellency seat
yourself? Here is coffee <i>alla Turca</i>."</p>

<p>The count drew up his chair, and took
the proffered cup. As he lit a cigarette, his
eyes travelled appreciatively over the portraits
of a dozen Dentons, famous in the
service of their country. "It is fitting we
should meet here," he said, "surrounded by
these illustrious gentlemen, who look on, but
cannot move. It is prophetic."</p>

<p>"It is Kismet," said the Vizier gravely.</p>

<p>"Kismet, assisted by two statesmen,"
returned the Count. "Exactly. But I mustn't
lose time, Vizier, as our moments are precious."
He put his hand into his breast
pocket, and produced a document. "Here
is the draft of our understanding, arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
so far as is possible with three thousand
versts between us. Now we must discuss
the final details. I have indicated my suggestions,
and if they meet with your approval
it will be possible for us to sign before you
leave London."</p>

<p>The Persian watched the smoke rings
float upward. "There is no haste," he said.
"'Fruit ripens slowly under grey skies,' as
our poet sings."</p>

<p>"Quite so&mdash;quite so," said the Russian,
conscious of an error. "This year&mdash;the next
will do. Our treasury has many drains upon
it. We are not anxious to add to the number."</p>

<p>The Vizier smoked imperturbably. "The
skies are grey here," he said at length, "but
this London holds some wonderful men.
One I met yesterday&mdash;an American. He is
young. His hair is still flaxen. Yet he
spoke of money as though it grew on rose
trees. Half a million roubles are as nothing
to him. He gave that sum for an Italian
picture&mdash;an old, shabby-looking thing such
as my master would not place in his anterooms.
He owns oil mines, railways, banks.
Allah! what does that flaxen-haired youth
not own? My heart ached at the number
of his possessions."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"These Americans talk," replied the
Count. "Half they say is false, half exaggeration."</p>

<p>"Sometimes, no doubt," said the Vizier,
"but not always. I know this man is rich.
He is one of the new kings of the earth.
We have already had a transaction together,"
and he sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>"There are kings and kings," replied the
Russian. "There are also emperors. Your
Excellency is now in negotiation with one
who controls the destinies of countless millions&mdash;men
and roubles. When last I saw
his Majesty he said, 'Tell his Excellency the
Grand Vizier that I would his wisdom could
be added to that of my counsellors. When
the wishes of my heart respecting the new
treaty are consummated he will honour me
by accepting half a million roubles.'"</p>

<p>The Persian gazed reflectively into space.
"Your master is great," he said, "and he
is generous. His rewards make glad the
hearts of poets. He is the joy of the poor.
Would that I were a poet or poor. So should
my voice praise him also."</p>

<p>The Russian's eye gleamed, but he continued
suavely:</p>

<p>"So said my royal master, 'Half a million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
roubles shall be his when the treaty is signed;
five hundred thousand more when the Russian
flag floats in the Persian Gulf.'"</p>

<p>The Persian leaned back resignedly.</p>

<p>"Great is the power of your master,"
he said. "As Russia is bigger than America,
so does his power exceed that of the flaxen-haired
gentleman I met yesterday. The
Americans are numbered by tens, your
master's subjects by hundreds of millions.
Besides, it is always more agreeable to deal
with a first-class diplomatist. Let me look
at the draft."</p>

<p>Count Moranoff handed over the document.
The Vizier read it slowly. The terms
were fairly comprehensive. Behind his curtain
Rivers breathed hard at their audacity,
and his blood tingled at the thought that
it rested with him to checkmate this daring
move. The statesmen discoursed frankly,
and there was no disguise of the object in
view. India was eventually to be attacked
by Russia, who was prepared to pay for
facilities granted. The north-eastern province
of Persia was a necessary factor of
the scheme, and a railway was to be commenced
at once from Astrabad to Meshed.
But the most striking part of the plan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the acquisition by Russia of a port in the
Persian Gulf. The Isle of Kishm was to be
ceded to her. The only discussion between
the two statesmen was with regard to the
Island of Ashurada in the Caspian. The
Vizier demanded its evacuation by Russia
in partial payment for Kishm, but more
particularly as a sop to the Persian people.
After much demur this was finally agreed
to by Moranoff, in addition to the annuity
of two million roubles granted to the Shah.</p>

<p>The Vizier folded up the document.</p>

<p>"My secretary shall transcribe this to-morrow,"
he said, "and we can sign after
our return from Windsor. Strange, is it
not," he soliloquised, "that our former negotiations
came to a head when the English
Mission brought the Garter, and our new one
is to be consummated while we are in the act
of returning the compliment? These English
are fated to be hoodwinked."</p>

<p>"When men such as you and I get together,
my dear Vizier&mdash;&mdash;" began the Russian
sententiously. Then he stopped short,
for the door had suddenly opened.</p>

<p>The Persian turned angrily, and then
rose to his feet as a tall, richly-dressed man
entered. It was the Prince Ali Azim.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vizier," said the Prince abruptly,
"whom have you here? Your physician?"</p>

<p>The Vizier's face had assumed a bland
smile, and instinctively he endeavoured to
cover the treaty. But the Prince saw the
movement.</p>

<p>"Why hide the prescription, Vizier?"
he said.</p>

<p>The Russian's face grew livid, but the
Vizier regained his usual composure.</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness," he said, "permit
me to present his Excellency Count Moranoff."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pardons, Count," said
the Prince, slightly returning the Count's
profound inclination. "You will, perhaps,
understand my mistake when I tell you that
the Vizier is far from well. He has, no
doubt, concealed the fact from you, but he
was too ill to accompany me this evening
to the hall of music. Hence my surprise
at finding him here. I fear that his extraordinary
zeal for affairs has led him prematurely
from his bed. I am sure that you
would not wish him to trespass unduly on
his strength."</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness's surmise is correct,"
said Moranoff. "It would, indeed,
be an international calamity were the Vizier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to break down. I hope I have not hastened
that end." He again bowed profoundly to
the Prince, refused the Vizier's offer of assistance
with his wraps, and then, with a cold
adieu to him, left the room.</p>

<p>"Now, Hasan Kuli," thundered the
Prince when they were alone, "what intrigue
is this?"</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness's suspicions are
uncalled for. Moranoff and I are old friends
by correspondence. We had never met
personally, and he naturally seized this
opportunity."</p>

<p>"I did not know he was in England,"
said the Prince. "The Russian Ambassador
incidentally referred to him to-day as being
in Petersburg. I left you in bed, full of
toothache and indigestion. I return unexpectedly,
and find you deliberating with a
Russian who is supposed to be five hundred
<i>farsakhs</i> away. Give me that paper."</p>

<p>The Vizier reluctantly produced it, and
the Prince read it through.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, as he refolded it. "I
see you are making a cat's-paw of me again.
My mission here is to do away with any
ill-effects consequent on our treaty with
Russia. You will remember that when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were fooling the English Mission in Teheran
I knew nothing of the treaty just concluded
with Russia. My uncle and you delighted
to keep me in the dark; yet all the time it
was I who did the work. Was it his Majesty
the Shah who played at billiards and cards
with the English? Was it you who fought
them at lawn tennis. Bah! I laugh at the
thought. But I played at all. I lost my
money at cards and billiards, and I suffered
defeat at lawn tennis till the perspiration
rolled down me, and my legs gave way. And
you smoked and laughed, and got all the
profit. I, who worked, got none. Now I
have come over land and sea with the Order of
the Lion and the Sun. Again I do the work&mdash;again
I know nothing. I find you intriguing
behind my back. You treat me as
a child; but you forget that some day I
may be Shah. You play with fire, Vizier."</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness, I beg you to
believe that I have acted for what I thought
was the benefit of our country."</p>

<p>"And your own pocket," added the
Prince. "How much plunder do you get
out of this?"</p>

<p>The Vizier held up his hands in horror.
"Your Royal Highness," he said, "is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
nothing ever done disinterestedly&mdash;from
pure patriotism?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="Man wearing a fez looking into a box" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SUDDENLY HE ROSE, TOOK THE DRAFT OF THE TREATY,
WENT TO THE DESPATCH BOXES, AND PLACED IT IN
ONE OF THEM.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_175">p. 175.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"Not by Hasan Kuli," sneered the Prince.
"Please save yourself useless declamation.
You may as well know my terms at once.
The price of my acquiescence in this matter
is one million roubles."</p>

<p>The Vizier gasped.</p>

<p>"One million roubles!" he exclaimed.
"Does money grow?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, it does not," replied
the Prince acidly. "But you may as well
spare yourself unnecessary questions. These
are my terms. Arrange with Moranoff to-morrow,
or take it from your own profit&mdash;I
care not which; but unless a portion of
the money is forthcoming before we leave
this cursed land I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will betray us?"</p>

<p>"I do not explain my intentions to
Viziers," replied the young man haughtily.
"You understand me, I hope. Here is your
treaty." He tossed the document on the
table and left.</p>

<p>The Vizier threw himself on a sofa, and
groaned aloud. He lay there long&mdash;so long
that Rivers, behind the curtain, was stiff
and weary. And there was the Vizier, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
apparently dozing at intervals&mdash;perhaps
going to make a night of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rose, took the draft of the
treaty, went to the despatch boxes, and
placed it in one of them. His body intervened
between Rivers' view of them, but
the watcher followed his movements as best
he could. Then the Vizier turned to the door,
and clicked out the light as he passed through.</p>

<p>Rivers stretched himself, but he did not
venture to stir from behind the curtain for
some time. At length he stepped out, turned
on his portable electric light, crossed the
room, and stood before the despatch boxes.</p>

<p>There were three, all exactly alike. One
held the insignia of the Lion and the Sun.
That was&mdash;yes, that was the bottom one.
The treaty was in the middle one. The top
one was unimportant. Rivers lifted out the
middle one, and essayed to open it with his
keys, but in vain. Then he tried the bottom
one&mdash;that containing the Persian Order&mdash;but
with no better success. The box would have
to be forced open elsewhere. Yet he dare
not carry it across the hall. Other means
had to be found for getting it out of the
room, and the way had occurred to him as
he stood behind the curtain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>One box he might pass safely through this
instrumentality, but only one. Two would
court defeat. Which box was he to take&mdash;the
one that held the Order of the Lion
and the Sun, the object of all his scheming,
or the other, in which lay the treaty?</p>

<p>Rivers' mind had taken its resolve at
the instant he had seen the draft placed
therein. Since Moranoff had appeared, he
had lost all immediate interest in the Burglars'
Club. Whether he became a member
or not was of little moment, but it was a
matter of national importance that the
Foreign Secretary should see the draft of
the treaty. The Earl of Ancoats was hard
to convince of anyone's dishonesty. His
own honour was so untarnished that he
refused to believe less of others. He had
declined to take hints about the former
treaty between Russia and Persia, and now,
with the Shah's Mission at his door, he would
probably refuse to believe that this was but
another blind, covering a further and bolder
intrigue. Lord Ancoats must see the treaty.</p>

<p>Rivers took the middle box across to the
window, then drew up the blind and waited.
The red-coated sentry passed. Could he
manage it before the soldier was round again?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! here was his chance.</p>

<p>He opened the window gently. "Hi!"
he called out to the passing hansom. The man
pulled up, got down, and came to the window.</p>

<p>"I want you to take this box straight
to Lord Ancoats. He lives in Eaton Square.
Tell him Mr. Birket Rivers sent it, and he
must open it at once. I will see him in
the morning about it. Here's a sovereign.
If Lord Ancoats gets it within an hour, I'll
give you another sovereign to-morrow. Here
you are. Cut along. Drive like blazes."</p>

<p>As the man mounted his seat, the sentry
came round the corner. Rivers cautiously
closed the window, and drew the blind.
He then pulled a chair behind the curtain,
and went to sleep on it till four o'clock,
when he made his way to his own room.</p>

<p>First thing in the morning he sent a
message to John Parker, who turned up in
good health at ten o'clock, and claimed his
post back.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Rivers left, assured of
Mr. Bradshaw's offer of the next vacancy
in the household. He drove straight to the
Albany, and then to Eaton Square. The
Earl was at the Foreign Office. Within the
hour his lordship received him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Rivers," said Lord Ancoats,
producing the despatch box from a safe.
"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i_178.jpg" width="355" height="500" alt="Two men looking into a box" />
<span class="caption">&quot;INSTEAD OF THE DRAFT, THERE, ON A PURPLE VELVET
CUSHION, WAS THE GLITTERING ORDER OF THE LION
AND THE SUN.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_178">p. 178.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"It explains itself, my lord."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the statesman drily.
"What do you think it contains?"</p>

<p>"The draft of a new treaty between
Russia and Persia."</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p>Rivers did so, and, instead of the draft,
there on a purple velvet cushion was the
glittering Order of the Lion and the Sun!</p>

<p>Rivers was stupefied.</p>

<p>"Was there nothing else?" he asked in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"No, sir; and perhaps you will now
explain how you came into possession of
this, and why you sent it to me. It is surely
the property of the Persian Mission."</p>

<p>Lord Ancoats' demeanour was not reassuring,
but Rivers plunged boldly into the
matter.</p>

<p>"Last night, at Denton House, Count
Moranoff visited the Persian Vizier," he commenced.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I saw him. I was present at the interview&mdash;unknown,
of course. He brought with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
him the draft of a treaty supplementing the
last one. It had chiefly reference to the
acquisition of a Russian port in the Persian
Gulf."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lord Ancoats, "that's a
bold move. Go on, please."</p>

<p>"The Vizier placed the draft in one of
three despatch boxes like this. I thought
this was the one, and I sent it here so that
your lordship could read the treaty for yourself.
I deeply regret that I made a mistake
in the box, but I can give the gist of the
treaty from memory."</p>

<p>"Please do so now."</p>

<p>Rivers' memory was good, and the words
of the treaty had burnt themselves on his
brain. He recited the terms without hesitation.
The minister heard him in silence,
making notes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Rivers," he said at the end.
"You will please let me have that in writing
in time for to-morrow's Cabinet." Then he
got up and paced the room. "It is an unfortunate
situation. I think we shall be
able to meet the political side of it, but the
investiture takes place at Windsor to-morrow,
and this discovery is, to say the least, embarrassing.
However, we have to thank you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for being forewarned. You evidently anticipated
this move."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, sir. It was as much
luck as anything else on my part."</p>

<p>"But you were at Denton House?"</p>

<p>"I was there on other business," said
Rivers frankly.</p>

<p>Lord Ancoats looked grave. "Well, Mr.
Rivers," he said, "I will not inquire too
closely what that other business was. You
have rendered a service to the State which
will not be forgotten. Now, what about
this?" pointing to the box.</p>

<p>"I will see that the Vizier gets it."</p>

<p>"At once?"</p>

<p>Rivers hesitated. Only then did he remember
he now had in his possession what
he wanted. He could pay his entrance fee.</p>

<p>"I will see that it is at Denton House
by the morning," he said.</p>

<p>Lord Ancoats watched him intently.</p>

<p>"Does the Burglars' Club meet to-night?"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," stammered
Rivers.</p>

<p>Lord Ancoats laid a kindly hand on his
shoulder. "I was only told of that institution
within the hour," he said, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
till a moment ago I didn't believe the information.
Take my advice, Rivers, and
leave it. Its existence, you see, is known to
some of the outside world. As a friend I
warn you that you will be watched to-night.
Don't spoil your career. Why did you leave
the Service? Oh, I remember; but you're
not satisfied with merely killing time, are
you? Will you come back to us? The
First Secretaryship at Vienna is vacant.
Would you take it?"</p>

<p>Rivers' face beamed. "I'd jump at it,
my lord."</p>

<p>"Then be ready to start in a week.
Never mind thanks. I am still your debtor.
Now about this box? You might be unable
to restore it. We must adopt other means."</p>

<p>Lord Ancoats opened the door of an
adjoining room with, "Come forward,
please." And the little detective whom
Rivers had last seen at Denton House that
very morning entered briskly.</p>

<p>"I believe you have met before?" said
Lord Ancoats.</p>

<p>Rivers was too astonished to reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have met James Finny&mdash;I beg
pardon&mdash;Mr. Birket Rivers," said the detective
drily.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Rivers has explained the mystery
very satisfactorily, Marvell," said Lord Ancoats.
"The box should be restored without
delay. Will you do this, please?"</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell tried to look pleased, but
signally failed in the attempt.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord," he replied.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and a
clerk appeared with a card in his hand.</p>

<p>"I must leave you now," said the Minister.
"Rivers, next week, remember. I
am much obliged for your assistance, Mr.
Marvell."</p>

<p>With this the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
left the room.</p>

<p>The detective took up the box.</p>

<p>"How on earth did you come into this
matter, Mr. Marvell?" asked Rivers.</p>

<p>"Very simply, sir. When Lord Ancoats
got the box he telephoned to Scotland Yard,
and I was sent for at once. As a matter
of fact, I opened the box for his lordship.
You're sure you wouldn't like to restore it
yourself? The Vizier is ill in bed, and it
won't be wanted till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Marvell,"
Rivers laughed; "but I'm sure it's safer
in your hands."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Marvell nodded grimly. "Sooner or
later, sir. Sooner or later," he said, as he
walked to the door; "but don't try to be
a footman next time."</p>

<p>With these enigmatical remarks the interview
terminated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following day the investiture of
the Lion and the Sun took place at Windsor.
After the ceremony Prince Ali Azim and
the Vizier had a private interview with
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
It was noted at the time that the Persians
emerged looking singularly subdued.</p>

<p>That evening, in reply to a friendly
question addressed by the Leader of the
Opposition, Lord Ancoats took the opportunity
to assure the House that the paramount
influence of England in the Persian
Gulf would be maintained at any cost, and
a month later the Union Jack floated by the
side of the Arab Sultan's flag on the castle
towers of Muscat.</p>

<p>This was the answer given to the Russian
intrigue. That it was so effective and complete
was owing to the action of Mr. Birket
Rivers, sometime a cadet member of the
Burglars' Club.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2>IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HORSESHOE AND THE PEPPERCORN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> President rose and read: "'March 29th
is the anniversary of the Battle of Towton.
For valour on that desperate field John de
Mallaby received from Edward IV. the Barony
of Tadcaster, and an appropriate grant of
land in Yorkshire, at a yearly rental of a
peppercorn and a golden horseshoe. That
rent is still paid by the Barons&mdash;now Earls&mdash;of
Tadcaster. His late lordship used to
bring his annual acknowledgment to town
in a state coach with outriders, but the
present peer takes it to his Sovereign by
motor-car, attended only by a chauffeur.'</p>

<p>"In this paragraph, my lords and gentlemen,"
continued the Duke, "we see indicated
the quest of our distinguished fellow member
Captain Prescott Cunningham, whose subscription
is now due."</p>

<p>"What is the quest, Mr. President?"
inquired Cunningham. "Am I to capture
the peer or the motor-car?"</p>

<p>"Neither, sir," replied his Grace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Dorchester. "You will kindly produce the
horseshoe and the peppercorn intended for
the King on the 29th. Our meeting is
arranged for the 28th, so that we may
return the trophies in question, and enable
his lordship of Tadcaster to continue in
possession of his remarkably low-rented
estate."</p>

<p>The Right Honourable John de Mallaby,
D.L., F.R.S., M.A., Eighteenth Baron and
Seventh Earl of Tadcaster, lived chiefly
at his Westmorland seat, Kirkdale Castle,
which an ancestress in the time of George
the First had obligingly brought into the
family in addition to her own good looks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain Mr. Shaw arrived one day of
March last at the Golden Lion Inn, Kirkdale,
and there spent a few days, talking much
with the landlord and frequenters of the inn,
and taking walks in the neighbourhood of
the Castle. On the latter occasions he might
have been seen gazing somewhat disconsolately
at the battlemented walls which had
several times defied an army.</p>

<p>Once when he was so occupied, a thin,
grizzly, stooping gentleman had passed, and
with him a handsome dark-eyed girl. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
learnt that this was the Earl himself, a
scientific and somewhat eccentric widower,
and his only child Eva, a <i>débutante</i> of last
season.</p>

<p>Prescott Cunningham&mdash;for so was this
Mr. Shaw designated in the more accurate
books of the Registrar-General&mdash;soon gave
up any idea of entering the Castle in his
quest of the peppercorn and horseshoe.
The task of finding them there was too big.
He had learnt that on these annual occasions
Lord Tadcaster, accompanied by his chauffeur,
left the castle in his motor-car four
days before the King received him. He
also learnt full particulars of the route
followed and of the halting places, and it
was his final plan of campaign to waylay
his lordship on the road, and, unashamed,
to rob him of the articles desired.</p>

<p>Having spent three days in coming to
this conclusion, Cunningham moved on to
Bolton Abbey, through which village he
knew that his lordship would pass on his
way to Harrogate, where he would spend
the night of the 25th.</p>

<p>At five o'clock on the day in question,
the Tadcaster Panhard drew up at the
Devonshire Arms at Bolton Abbey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Cunningham saw to his amazement that,
instead of the Earl and his chauffeur, it contained
his lordship and a lady&mdash;his daughter.</p>

<p>Cunningham groaned in spirit. To tackle
two men single-handed might be counted
sporting, but a woman&mdash;hang it all!</p>

<p>Mine host hurried to the door to assist
his guests.</p>

<p>"Has your lordship lost Mr. Ackill?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied the Earl. "Achille
hurt his hand with a backfire this morning,
and I sent him on by train to Harrogate to
have it attended to. You got my note?
Dinner at six?"</p>

<p>"To the minute, my lord."</p>

<p>The intervening time was chiefly spent
by the Earl in confidential communion with
his motor, through the intermediary of a
spanner and an oil can.</p>

<p>While he was so engaged, and Cunningham
was lounging near the door, reflecting on his
bad luck, another car drove up, and two
loudly-dressed men emerged from their wraps.
They entered the hotel, drank thirstily, and
talked without restraint.</p>

<p>Lady Eva de Mallaby passed through
the hall soon afterwards. Struck by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
beauty, one of the motorists, with the
comradeship of one sportsman to another,
addressed some remark to her, with a
generous smile and a casual hat-lift.</p>

<p>Lady Eva, showing a trace of surprise,
stared icily at the man and passed on.</p>

<p>"Hoity, toity," said the motorist, without
any sign of shame. "But I'd like to have
the breaking-in of you, Miss. Wouldn't you,
Sammy?" addressing his companion.</p>

<p>"Too expensive," said Sammy. "Give
me a four-year-old, like I bought to-day
from Sir William, an' I'm 'appy."</p>

<p>"You're a bloomin' materialist, that's
what you are, Sammy," retorted the other&mdash;"a
bloomin' materialist." He lingered
lovingly over the rounded phrase, and drained
his glass again.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the sound of a
gramophone percolated the house.</p>

<p>Lord Tadcaster was at dinner.</p>

<p>It was his daily custom to dine to the
accompaniment of music. When at home
his private band officiated; when he was
on his travels a musical-box or gramophone
supplied the necessary melody.</p>

<p>This was an eccentricity of the peer,
who had decided, after long and recondite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
diagnosis, that music assists the digestion,
and that certain music is more suited to
a particular food than another. Therefore
he swallowed his soup to a dreamy
prelude, his fish to a fugue. The <i>entrée</i> was
expedited by Beethoven, the joint disappeared
to a triumphal march. Sweets demanded
a waltz, cheese nothing more than a negro
melody; but with wine and dessert were
combined all the possibilities of Grand Opera.</p>

<p>Cunningham had learnt particulars of all
this when at Kirkdale, and now he listened
to the programme emanating from the private
dining-room. No doubt owing to the absence
of Achille, the music occasionally gave out,
but by the intermittent tunes Cunningham
was still able to gauge the progress of the
meal. The omission of a sonata denoted
limitation of the repast, and when the strains
of "Lucia di Lammermoor" throbbed on the
air Cunningham mounted his motor-cycle,
and took the road that led through Blubber-houses.</p>

<p>A run of three-quarters of an hour brought
him to the confines of Haverah Park, almost
within sight of Harrogate. It was here that
he had decided to waylay the motor-car.</p>

<p>It was a lonely spot indeed. Moorland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
grim pasture land, lean fir trees, stone walls
and limestone road, was all that met the
eye. All was cold and stern. Cold and
stern was his business that night; and
there, close to the wood granted by John o'
Gaunt to one Haverah, and tenanted since
Doomsday by the winds of the centuries,
he waited.</p>

<p>The air was springlike, but the wait was
long and weary. The only satisfactory thing
about it was that he had time to note the
small amount of traffic on the road. A
solitary dogcart was all that passed in an
hour.</p>

<p>The moon rose in cold splendour. The
stars appeared. Cunningham knew only one
of them by name&mdash;Betelgeuse, a red star,
the apex of a triangle of which three stars
formed the base. The name had struck him
as remarkable, and he once had called a
bull pup after it. For a moment he thought
of his dog's untimely end.</p>

<p>But was the Panhard never coming?
Perhaps there had been a puncture, and
in the absence of a chauffeur Lord Tadcaster
was stranded. Possibly he had returned to
Bolton Abbey, or taken train forward, or,
since he was short-handed, he might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
altered his route and gone by the easier road
through Otley. In that case, he, Prescott
Cunningham, was lost to the Burglars' Club.</p>

<p>Ah! There was the toot of a motor
in the far distance, again repeated. It was
the Tadcaster toot&mdash;a base twentieth century
substitute for the cry that on the field
of Towton in 1461 led another John de
Mallaby to a barony and an estate.</p>

<p>Cunningham recovered his cycle, be-straddled
it, and gently mounted the rise
in front. The Panhard dashed up the hill,
its acetylene lamps glaring like man-o'-war
searchlights.</p>

<p>Cunningham advanced his spark. The
motor responded, and sprang eagerly after
the car. They were leaving him behind.
He slowly opened his throttle valve. Now
he was making pace. He was gaining on
them yard by yard, hand over fist. He
was only a hundred yards behind now&mdash;fifty&mdash;twenty-five.
Could he do it? The
psychological moment had come.</p>

<p>He drew his revolver and aimed at the
near back tyre of the car in front. Ah!
he had missed. He hit it with his second
shot. It split with a rousing bang. The
car listed and dragged. It swerved across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the road in violent curves, but Cunningham
saw by the slowing of the speed that the
driver had thrown out his clutch. At last
it stopped.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i_192.jpg" width="372" height="500" alt="Man holding gun on two men in an automobile" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;SOFTLY, MY LORD,&#39; SAID CUNNINGHAM; &#39;I AM COVERING
YOU, YOU OBSERVE.&#39;&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_192">p. 192.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"What's the meaning of this outrage,
you scoundrel?" cried the infuriated
motorist.</p>

<p>"Softly, my lord," said Cunningham,
now on his feet, and advancing with revolver
in hand. "I am covering you, you
observe!"</p>

<p>"A highwayman, by George!" exclaimed
the peer. "And Edward VII. on the throne.
A highwayman on castors!"</p>

<p>"Your lordship evidently recognises the
situation," said Cunningham. "This will
save time and trouble, I hope."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want my purse?" replied
the peer. "This comes of travelling without
my chauffeur," he added plaintively. "By
George, if Achille were here, he'd worry you.
If I were ten years younger I'd tackle you
myself."</p>

<p>"Regrets are futile, my lord," said Cunningham,
"but a purse will not satisfy me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want two, do you? Eva, I'm
afraid you'll have to give him yours as well.
Shockin' luck for this to happen the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
time we've travelled alone. I oughtn't to
have let you come."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, dad, please," said Lady
Eva. "I'm sorry I haven't got a purse,
highwayman," she continued contemptuously,
throwing back her thick veil to see
what manner of man this could be, "but
the few loose sixpences I have in my pocket
are quite at your service."</p>

<p>"You may keep them, madam," Cunningham
replied, with as much dignity as the
occasion would permit. "I do not ask for
money. I simply want the loan of a peppercorn
and golden horseshoe until the 29th."</p>

<p>"By George, he must be an antiquarian
highwayman or a curio-collector gone mad,"
said his lordship. "D'ye think, sir, I'll give
you what I'm taking to the King?"</p>

<p>"His Majesty shall have them, and from
your hands, on the proper day. I simply
ask for the loan of them till then."</p>

<p>"You must think that I'm a fool," said
the Earl. In an instant he had grabbed the
hoop of one of the heavy acetylene lamps,
and pulled it from its socket. "Take that,
you blackguard!" he yelled, flinging it with
all his force at the cyclist.</p>

<p>Cunningham dodged the missile, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
crashed to the ground with light extinguished.</p>

<p>"Hands up, my lord," he shouted, "or
I fire."</p>

<p>The discomfited peer obeyed him.</p>

<p>"You are quite at my mercy," said
Cunningham sternly. "The peppercorn and
horseshoe at once, if you please, or I shall
have to use force. I trust you will avoid
a scene before your daughter. You may
lower your right hand to your pocket."</p>

<p>The Earl did as he was bid, drew out
the precious packet, and handed it to Cunningham.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," he replied. "You
are wise. I promise you they shall be returned
on the morning of the 29th. To
what address?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," retorted the peer.
"But I stay at Claridge's. Now, if you've
anything of a sportsman about you, you'll
go on to the Queen Hotel at Harrogate and
tell my chauffeur, Achille Petibon, to come
with a repairer at once. We can't spend the
night here. I've got a spare cover and tube
in the tonneau, but I can no more fit them
than fly. My finger-nails are far too brittle."</p>

<p>"I will convey your message with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
greatest pleasure, my lord," replied Cunningham.
"I sincerely regret the inconvenience
I have caused, though you may not think so."</p>

<p>For a moment there was a pause, and Cunningham
could have gone. Yet he hesitated.</p>

<p>The moon shone down upon a desolate
moorland glade, lighting up the green sward
by the trees. The excitement of the adventure,
the flush of victory, a pair of bright
eyes, and the memory of some half-forgotten
romance stirred his blood.</p>

<p>"One final favour, my lord," he said.</p>

<p>"No more, sir. By George, if I were ten
years younger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You carry a gramophone with you."</p>

<p>"You are remarkably well informed as
to my luggage, sir. I do, but it's too bulky
for you to carry away. They're cheap
enough. A man of taste like yourself ought
to be able to afford one of his own."</p>

<p>"I don't want to take it away, my lord.
I simply want the favour of a dance tune
and a lady's hand."</p>

<p>For a moment the Earl looked puzzled.
Then he exclaimed: "By George! Claude
Duval up to date! No, sir, I'll be hanged
if&mdash;&mdash;" His lordship stopped suddenly. He
was keen of hearing, and as he spoke he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had heard, or thought he heard, a distant
car. Even if it meant a dance with his
daughter, he would detain the man until
assistance arrived. In a moment he had
altered his voice.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts, sir," he said, "I
don't know. After all, it's a tradition of
your&mdash;er&mdash;profession. Perhaps you will
oblige the gentleman, Eva." As he spoke
he pressed the girl's hand so that she might
know that something lay behind his words.
"Where's the gramophone?" he asked.
While searching for the instrument his
lordship actually started whistling, lest the
highwayman should also hear the car.</p>

<p>"Ah, here it is," he said aloud. Then,
in a whisper to his daughter, "Car coming.
Distract his attention." In his anxiety his
lordship even hummed as he hurriedly manipulated
the instrument, inserting the first
record that came to hand.</p>

<p>He wound up the toy, and a baritone
voice sang raucously:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Egypt! my Cleopatra! I ain't no flatt'rer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But dis is true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(I'm a-goin' to tell her)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Egypt! if you don't want me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span><br />
</div>

<p>In a trice Lady Eva had found a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
suitable record, and after a momentary pause
the instrument struck up "The Darkie Cake
Walk," as played by the New York Municipal
Band, at Manhattan Beach, Long Island,
U.S.A.</p>

<p>"May I have the honour?" asked
Cunningham, hat in hand, with a low bow.</p>

<p>Lady Eva inclined coldly, and took off
her wraps. The man was certainly polite.
He led her as though she were a princess,
and any misgivings were soon at rest.</p>

<p>It was a quaint scene. It is doubtful
if Betelgeuse had ever looked down upon
a quainter. The firs formed a sombre background.
The moon illuminated the green
sward in front, and on it a highwayman
and a lady motorist stepped to a
catching dance tune, emanating from a
gramophone on a Panhard motor, controlled
by a peer of the realm. The light of an
acetylene lamp shone like a gigantic foot-light
illuminating the front of the green
stage.</p>

<p>The floor was not an ideal one, though
cattle had cropped it close and the winds
had swept it dry, but the pair were accomplished
dancers. Thrice had they paced
the length of the floor. Now they turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
again, hand in hand, with heads thrown
back, and uplifted feet. There was the
unmistakable sound of an approaching car.
Cunningham must have heard it, but recklessly
he continued the dance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_198.jpg" width="550" height="339" alt="Man and woman dancing in front of a car; man seated next to victrola in car; man in car looking behind him" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THERE WAS THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING CAR.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_198">p. 198.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>With a toot it hove into sight, and Lord
Tadcaster turned his own horn into a prolonged
howl, signifying unimaginable trouble.
This, and the unusual scene at the side,
brought up the oncoming car to a smart
halt. They backed abreast of the Panhard.</p>

<p>"Robbery! Help!" cried the Earl.</p>

<p>The two occupants of the new car hardly
heard him. They were lost in astonishment.
As the dancers reached the verge of the road
in the full flare of the light, they were greeted
with a round of applause. With a snap
Lord Tadcaster turned off the gramophone.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm jiggered!" said one of the
newcomers. "If it ain't little Hoity Toity!"</p>

<p>The peer had jumped from the Panhard.
"Help me to secure this highwayman," he
said, pointing to Cunningham. "He has
robbed me."</p>

<p>The man who had just spoken also got
down, but his companion remained on the
car, stolidly surveying the scene.</p>

<p>"Come along," said the peer to his recruit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
"I think we can manage him between
us."</p>

<p>"Stow it, old man," said the motorist.
"You collar the highwayman, and I'll look
after the lady."</p>

<p>He brushed past the Earl, and, with
proffered arm, smirked, "May I have the
next dance, Miss?"</p>

<p>Lady Eva drew back. The man came
still nearer. Instinctively she touched Cunningham's
arm for protection.</p>

<p>"Stand back, sir!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"Who the juggins are you?" sneered
the man. "This old buffer says you're a
highwayman, but you seem to think you're
a bloomin' bobby. You git, and let me have
my partner for the high-kick lancers."</p>

<p>"If you come one step nearer I'll thrash
you," said Cunningham.</p>

<p>The man needed no further encouragement.
He even dared to touch the lady's
arm. A second later he measured his length
on the turf.</p>

<p>His friend tumbled from his seat with
anxious chivalry.</p>

<p>"'Ere, you leave my pal alone," he said,
rolling up to Cunningham.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Sammy," said the other, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
slowly to his feet. "Now, look you here,
Mr. Highwayman," he continued vindictively.
"You've had your score, now I'll
have mine. Either this lady has a hop
with me to my own time and tune, and
gives me a kiss at the end, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?"</p>

<p>"Or I ride on to Harrogate, and give the
police information of highway robbery."</p>

<p>"There's your car," said Cunningham.
"Ride on."</p>

<p>"He's not likely to wait for the arrival
of the police," said the Earl ruefully, yet
anxious for the departure of these impossible
helpers.</p>

<p>"I shall be back with a bobby in twenty
minutes," the man rejoined, "and we'll
telephone to every town in the district so
that he can't escape. I'm not in fightin'
form myself to-night, so I'd rather do it
in proper legal style. I'll bring a solicitor
if I can find one. Now, young feller," he
continued, "you'd better consider well. It'll
be a twelve months' touch for you for robbery
and six for 'sault and battery. Are you
going to let your friend sacrifice himself on
the altar of nonsense, Miss? I think our
steps 'ud soot each other amazing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Cunningham advanced on him threateningly.
"If you dare to speak another word
to the lady you'll find yourself on the ground
again," he said.</p>

<p>The man retreated before him, and
Sammy fled. "Right 'o," said the former.
"You've had your choice. It's plank and
skilly for you now. Get up, Sammy." He
bundled his friend into his seat, himself
followed, let in the clutch, and they disappeared.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Please don't worry about it," replied
Cunningham. "The whole thing is the result
of my own folly. It serves me jolly
well right if I suffer for it."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better try to escape now?"
she asked, only remembering his protection
of her.</p>

<p>Cunningham shook his head. "I think
not," he replied. "It's probably all a ruse
on his part to get me away. Then he might
return and&mdash;and annoy you."</p>

<p>Lady Eva was silent.</p>

<p>"By George, sir," said the Earl, "I like
your spirit. What the deuce do you want
with that peppercorn and shoe? Give me
'em back and I'll say no more about it all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Cunningham smiled a little sadly. "I'm
afraid I can't. But you shall have them
on the morning of the 29th without fail.
Perhaps you'll believe me now." Then,
after a pause, he added: "I'll make a dash
for it if they aren't back in a quarter of
an hour. In that case, I shall conclude
that they really have gone to give the
alarm."</p>

<p>The minutes passed. Lady Eva bit her
lips in thought. Cunningham looked alternately
from her to Betelgeuse and the moon.
The peer stared stolidly into space.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Cunningham suddenly.
"Aren't we wasting time? Why wait for
assistance? I think I can put on a new
tyre, if you will allow me. Where are your
spare tubes and covers, and your jack?"</p>

<p>His lordship accepted the offer with
alacrity, and the two men were soon busy
round the wheel.</p>

<p>Cunningham ceased work for a moment
to take Lady Eva her furs, and assist her
into them. She sat down on a tree stump,
holding the remaining lamp, and turning
its light on the work.</p>

<p>She did this mechanically. All the while
she was thinking gravely. Suddenly a smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
passed over her face, and she nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>The men were so busy that they did not
pause at the sound of the returning car.
Sammy's friend was better than his word.
They had barely been gone fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>"That's the highwayman&mdash;that young
feller. Arrest him for robbery!" shouted
the motorist, as he brought his car to a
standstill, and a policeman sprang down.</p>

<p>"Is that the charge, sir?" said the
policeman to Lord Tadcaster.</p>

<p>What the Earl would have replied is
uncertain, for before he could answer Lady
Eva had intervened.</p>

<p>"Robbery! What in the world do you
mean?" she cried, standing up, and flashing
the light on the policeman.</p>

<p>"That gentleman has taken me off my
beat to arrest a man for highway robbery."</p>

<p>"That gentleman is mistaken," replied
the girl. "We've had a breakdown. Surely
that is the person who promised to send
assistance from Harrogate. We want a
repairer, not a policeman."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe her!" cried the
motorist. "Ask the old 'un."</p>

<p>"Is that so, sir?" inquired the officer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have heard my daughter," replied
the Earl, astonished but loyal. "Of course
it is so."</p>

<p>The motorist's mouth opened, but no
words came forth. He was absolutely
speechless at this change of front.</p>

<p>"Anyway, there's an assault an' battery,"
said his friend hopefully. "'E
knocked 'im down," pointing to the protagonists
of the drama.</p>

<p>"For insulting a lady, I think," said
Cunningham.</p>

<p>"Gor!" snorted the driver, recovering
his speech. "Sold again, Sammy!" And
with a frightful hoot they passed into the
night.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" exclaimed the
policeman, with intense disgust. "And 'ere
I am, miles off my beat."</p>

<p>"My friends won't be long before they
are ready to start again, officer," said
Cunningham, "and they'll no doubt give
you a lift to Harrogate. In the meantime
you might relieve the lady of the trouble
of directing the light. Thank you," he
whispered to Lady Eva, as he took the
lamp from her. Her eyes met his and
smiled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The new tyre was at last adjusted. The
Earl, Lady Eva, and the policeman got on
board and sped away, Cunningham accompanying
them on his motor-cycle.</p>

<p>In the outskirts of Harrogate the policeman
resumed his interrupted beat, the
richer by an unusual experience and a
sovereign.</p>

<p>At the town itself Cunningham said his
adieus.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks for your generosity,
my lord," he added. "You will not find
it misplaced," and with a low bow to Lady
Eva he took the road to the right.</p>

<p>The Earl watched him go regretfully,
for after all he had the horseshoe and peppercorn.
What Lady Eva's feelings were she
could not have stated precisely.</p>

<p>The Earl of Tadcaster and his daughter
arrived at their hotel in time to stop a
relief expedition, organised by the anxious
Achille; and under his care they resumed
their journey the next day.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 28th, Captain
Prescott Cunningham renewed his subscription
to the Burglars' Club; and at 9 a.m.
on the 29th there was delivered at Claridge's
Hotel a registered packet containing a peppercorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and a golden horseshoe, which the
eighteenth Baron Tadcaster presented to his
sovereign that afternoon at Buckingham
Palace.</p>

<p>Later on in the day a couple of new
tyres, "With Mr. Duval's compliments and
apologies," also reached the peer.</p>

<p>Here the story ends&mdash;for the present.
This happened last March. Cunningham
now attends every possible dance, dinner,
and reception, hoping that some day Lady
Eva and he may meet again; and as for
Lady Eva, does she not dream daily of
witching moonlight, a greensward dance, and
a brave and gallant partner?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>




<h2>X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HOLBEIN MINIATURE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Adolph Meyer</span>, the friend of nations,
the associate of kings, and the hope of the
impecunious, had built himself a house on
St. George's Island, off the coast of Hampshire.</p>

<p>As Mr. Meyer's origin was German, and
the country of his adoption was England, it
was perhaps natural that he should have gone
to Tuscany for the architecture of his marine
residence. Its boldly projecting cornices, its
rusticated base and quoins, the consoles of
its upper windows, all betrayed its Florentine
birth; but the lower windows, reaching to
the ground, were such as we associate with
the name of France, and were doubtless
intended as a compliment to the great and
gay nation living directly across the water.</p>

<p>To the south, a terrace, bounded by a
low wall set with dogs, apparently petrified
by their own ugliness, separated the villa
from the beach.</p>

<p>To the west were the orchid houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
To the north, before the front of the house,
lay the bowling green; beyond it a wood,
through which ran the path leading to the
landing-stage and the neighbouring island of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>A spiral staircase at the east end of the
house led to the observatory containing the
powerful equatorial telescope through which,
as opportunity offered, Mr. Meyer was wont
to gaze thoughtfully at the satellites of
Jupiter, the canals on Mars, and other
eccentricities of the heavens.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a fountain&mdash;between
the bowling green and the cypress trees.
There was also a sundial bearing a sentence
of cryptic import; and in the woods, at
the least expected places, stood marble
columns, broken and ivy-wreathed, or supporting
busts of Socrates, Pallas, Homer,
and other appropriate notabilities.</p>

<p>Inside the house were treasures that had
cost the ransom of a millionaire.</p>

<p>Meyer was a bachelor, and here he spent
his week-ends, absorbing ozone enough to
see him through till the following Saturday,
and maturing Titanic schemes for the
Federation of the World and the confounding
of rival financiers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Once only had he brought a guest with
him&mdash;an African Pro-Consul&mdash;who had with
much difficulty, though with ultimate success,
joined his outward-bound ship from Meyer's
electric launch.</p>

<p>Each year a local mayor called, admired,
wondered, and retired. Occasionally some
venturesome tourist was captured and
turned back. Other visitors were rare; and
their reception depended on the mood of
the lord of the island.</p>

<p>One day last April a stranger with a
camera rowed across from England. At the
landing-stage he informed the man in
charge that he had business with Mr. Meyer.
This was telephoned to the house.</p>

<p>"What business?" came the reply.</p>

<p>"Particular business," said the newcomer.</p>

<p>"What particular business?"</p>

<p>"Pictures," was the answer.</p>

<p>This was transmitted, and the reply taken.</p>

<p>"You can go," said the man, hanging
up the receiver. "Straight up the path,
and through the woods. Turn to the left
at the busk of 'Omer."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the visitor was shown
into a room facing the sea, in which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Meyer was seated by the open window,
reading from a gigantic folio.</p>

<p>He was a short, podgy man, with black
curly hair, a rounded nose, and bright eyes.
His moustache and imperial did not conceal
the extraordinary firmness of his mouth and
jaw.</p>

<p>He rose as his visitor entered. He was,
as usual, attired in a frock-coat and grey
trousers. Once he had been in flannels
when an emergency had arisen demanding
City attire, which was not immediately
forthcoming. Mr. Meyer had lost an opportunity
in life through carelessness. Therefore
on land he ever afterwards wore a
frock-coat, except when in evening dress or
pyjamas. The occasion should never again
find him wanting.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me on business?"
he asked. "What is it?"</p>

<p>His visitor, who was cast in a finer, less
decided mould&mdash;a good-looking, clean-shaven
man of something over thirty&mdash;replied:</p>

<p>"I came to ask for permission to photograph
the inside of your place."</p>

<p>"You are not from Mr. Holzmann, den?"
said Meyer, curtly.</p>

<p>"No."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said your business was imbortant."</p>

<p>"So it is&mdash;to myself."</p>

<p>Meyer looked sharply at him. "Why
do you want to photokraph my place?"</p>

<p>"For insertion in a magazine."</p>

<p>"Which makkazine?"</p>

<p>"Any that will take the article&mdash;I am
not proud. It is important that I should
make some money. I have seen many interesting
reproductions of interiors of the
stately homes of England in the periodicals,
but never one of your house. Hence my
appearance. I hope I may have your permission."</p>

<p>"Why should I krant you bermission?"
said Meyer. "I live here in solitude. I
do not bring visitors. I do not want dem.
Your intrusion is imbertinent."</p>

<p>His visitor flushed. "Sorry if I have
annoyed you," he said; "but it did not
seem such a great favour to ask. Most
people are glad to have pictures of themselves
and their houses in the papers."</p>

<p>"Most people are fools, as Dommas
Carlyle said. Have you a family?"</p>

<p>"I am not married."</p>

<p>"Dere is no excuse for a sinkle man
taking pictures of people's interiors. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
not de work for a man like you. I shall
not encourage such tomfoolery. No, I do
not give you bermission. But stay. Dere
is an orkit from de mittle of Africa of
which I should like to have a picture&mdash;de
<i>Cypripedium Meyeri</i>&mdash;a new species which I
have had de satisfaction to detect. Berhaps
you would be kind enough to photokraph
it for me, and your journey would not be
altokedder lost. Come along. What is your
name, please?"</p>

<p>His visitor handed him a card on which
was printed "John Lucas, 140, Brixton
Gardens, London, W."</p>

<p>"You have come a long way," Mr. Meyer
observed.</p>

<p>"A very long way, sir. Perhaps you
wouldn't mind letting me look round your
house, even if I may not photograph it.
I am interested in domestic architecture
and&mdash;er&mdash;curios."</p>

<p>Mr. Meyer looked intently at his visitor.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Lucas," he said slowly, "I
will also show you round my house, since
you have come so far, and are interested
in domestic architecture and curios. I have
blenty of both. Den we will photokraph
de orkit."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Meyer led the photographer through
his villa, pointing out its architectural beauties,
and indicating the various treasures
which it contained.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas was profuse in his expressions
of appreciation. "Are you not afraid of
burglars?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am afraid of noding," replied Mr.
Meyer. "Odderwise I should not be here
to-day in dis Tuscan Villa. I have gone
into de question of dieves, and tink I should
be able to meet de situation."</p>

<p>They had made a tour of the rooms, had
ascended the heights of the observatory and
inspected the electric plant at its base.</p>

<p>"Is dere anyting else you would like to
see?" asked Mr. Meyer politely.</p>

<p>"I believe that you collect miniatures.
Might I look at them?"</p>

<p>"Come dis way."</p>

<p>In a corner of the marble hall there was
a cabinet facing a window. Meyer stood
before it. "See," he said; "I bress dis
button, and it releases de trawers. So."</p>

<p>The shutter flew back, and the drawers
were free. Meyer opened them, one by one,
and indicated their contents. "Dey are all
choice examples of de best masters. Dese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
are Gosways. Dis is an Engleheart," and
so on. He went through the collection till
he had shown the last drawer but one. He
was about to close the cabinet when Mr.
Lucas asked: "Have you any Holbeins?"</p>

<p>"One," replied Meyer, "and dere was
I necklecting to show it to you. Dis last
trawer is de most imbortant of de lot."
He opened it and drew forth a small square
frame. "Here is de latest addition to my
collection. A krand Holbein. You notice
de blue backkround, characteristic of dat
kreat master, and de wonderful thin bainting.
You can almost see through it. It is a
bortrait of Meyer of Basle, berhaps a relation
of mine, berhaps not. It does not matter.
It is a fine picture. Don't you tink so?"</p>

<p>Lucas handed it back. "I envy you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Dere is no need," Mr. Meyer responded,
as he closed the cabinet. "'Enfy no man
till he is dead,' said de old Kreek philosopher,
and I am very much alife. Now come to
de orkit house, and photokraph de <i>Cypripedium
Meyeri</i>."</p>

<p>An hour later, after taking photographs
of the rare exotic from every point of the
compass, Mr. Lucas made his way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
landing-stage, and from thence he rowed
thoughtfully across to Bournemouth.</p>

<p>On the following Monday night a boat
with a solitary oarsman put off from the
mainland, and after several changes of
route was successfully beached on the
south shore of St. George's Island. Under
the protection of the trees its occupant&mdash;none
other, indeed, than Mr. John Lucas&mdash;stealthily
approached the Tuscan Villa,
which stood out in bold relief in the vivid
moonlight.</p>

<p>He gained the terrace, and, keeping as
much as possible within the shadow of the
balustrade and dogs, he crept to the fourth
window, the one at which Mr. Meyer was
sitting on the preceding Saturday.</p>

<p>There is no use disguising the fact any
longer. Mr. Lucas was a burglar, and he
now proceeded to act after the manner of
his craft. After affixing some adhesive
material to the pane, he began to cut out
a square of the window. The glass was
thick, so the process was long, but Mr.
Lucas toiled at it with a patience and
perseverance worthy of a better cause.
Only once did he desist&mdash;to follow the
suggestion of a sudden impulse, and try all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the windows of the house. But each was
fastened, and Mr. Lucas resumed his original
labour.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour before he drew out
the square of glass which enabled him to
undo the catch inside. Then nearly as long
passed before the removal of a second square
at the foot allowed him to unscrew the
bottom fastening.</p>

<p>The window was open at last, and Lucas
stepped inside.</p>

<p>It was the second burglary of his life,
and he reflected that so far all that had
happened was greatly to the credit of his
professional abilities. A moment afterwards
he was chilled by the later thought that
nothing in particular had happened so far,
and that the possibilities of the near future
were very great indeed.</p>

<p>With his stealthy entry into Mr. Meyer's
villa the personality of that gentleman had
suddenly oppressed him. At Bournemouth
all that day, with the sun shining, and the
band playing popular airs, Mr. Meyer had
occurred to him merely as an eccentric
German gentleman; but now, at something
after midnight, in the deathly stillness of
his villa, Mr. Lucas only remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Teuton's sharp, decisive utterances, his
piercing glances, and his large general reputation
for unpleasantness as an enemy.
Perhaps it was the sight of Mr. Meyer's
empty chair that had brought this train
of thought to his mind. The big folio he
had been reading was still at its side. Lucas
flashed his electric pocket light on the open
page. "Love's Labour's Lost" met his eyes.
This struck him as ominous.</p>

<p>Lucas pulled himself together. What had
he to do with empty chairs, and old folios,
and omens? He was a burglar, out for the
night on urgent business. Let him attend
to it, and keep his dreams and soliloquies
for the daytime. He walked across the
polished floor, his rubber soles being absolutely
noiseless. He raised the heavy curtain,
and passed beneath it through the
archway.</p>

<p>There in front of him was the marble
hall, bathed in coloured moonlight. The
fountain played softly to the tones of gold,
azure and red cast from the stained-glass
window. If Mr. Lucas had been conversant
with Keats he would doubtless have thought
of St. Agnes' Eve; but presumably Mr.
Lucas did not, for, keeping well to the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he stole quickly across to where stood the
case containing the miniatures.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="323" height="500" alt="Man standing with back to cabinet, dropping something into his pocket" />
<span class="caption">&quot;LUCAS DROPPED IT CAREFULLY INTO THE POCKET OF
HIS NORFOLK JACKET.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_218">p. 218.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"You bress de button, and it releases
de trawers. So." He smiled as Mr. Meyer's
pronunciation came back to him. He followed
the instructions, and the drawers were
free.</p>

<p>Cosway and Engleheart did not detain
him to-night. He opened the bottom drawer.
There lay the Holbein for which Mr. Meyer
had recently paid three thousand guineas.
Lucas dropped it carefully into the pocket
of his Norfolk jacket, shut the drawer, and
closed the case.</p>

<p>So far all was well&mdash;very well indeed.
Only a few yards, a curtain, and a few yards
more, lay between him and freedom. Then
again there fell upon him a sense of Mr.
Meyer's personality. What had that man
not done? He had browbeaten an Emperor,
hoodwinked a couple of wily Chancellors,
and decimated the ranks of rival practitioners.
Was he, John Lucas, a mere tyro in the
burglary profession, able to outwit the
smartest man of the day? Had he only
to break a window, step across a floor, seize
a treasure, and depart?</p>

<p>No&mdash;it was impossible. The very ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with which everything had been accomplished
was the worst sign of all. "I have gone
into de question of dieves, and tink I should
be able to meet de situation." Meyer's
words came back to him now. He himself
was in town&mdash;Lucas had seen him depart
that morning, to make it absolutely certain&mdash;but
his myrmidons were doubtless hidden
around. An electric shock would suddenly
hold him fast, and Meyer's butler or stage
manager, or whatever he was called, would
appear and wing him&mdash;unless the servants
were asleep in their master's absence. But
nothing was ever left to chance in Mr. Meyer's
life or his house. The very silence was eloquent
of impending catastrophe.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Lucas reproached himself with
nervous folly. "It is only my second burglary,"
he reflected apologetically. He
stepped across the hall, and once more
raised the curtain.</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>The room, which ten minutes ago was
dark and empty, was now brilliantly illuminated,
and there was Mr. Adolph Meyer,
seated in his chair!</p>

<p>Meyer rose and came forward. "Ah,
Mr. Lucas," he said, "dis is indeed a pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Not altokedder unexbected, I admit;
but it is always satisfactory to find one's
conclusions brove correct. I taught you
would have to return to make some final
notes on my domestic architecture and my
curios. You have seen my place by day.
Now you visit me by night. Dat is
charming."</p>

<p>Lucas stood by the curtain, overwhelmed
with confusion. Not by a word did Mr.
Meyer betray any resentment at his presence,
but there was a thinly disguised vein of
banter in his speech that made the burglar's
pulses quicken.</p>

<p>"Berhaps you have not noticed de view
I have here, Mr. Lucas," said Meyer. "Come
and look."</p>

<p>He threw open the window wide. The
moon was playing on the waters of the
Channel. Clouds were scurrying across the
sky. A lighthouse flashed in the far distance.</p>

<p>"I like dis view," said Meyer. "De sea
is always de same&mdash;deep and treacherous.
One always knows what to exbect, but man
you never know. How do you look upon
de sea, Mr. Lucas?"</p>

<p>"Good for boating, and&mdash;er&mdash;bathing,"
responded Lucas desperately.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goot for boating and bading," repeated
Meyer. "Dat is so. You are practical.
Dat is where you islanders have the advantage
over us treamers. But somehow the
treams have a habit of outlasting de practice.
I do not tink of boating and bading
when I look on de sea. I tink of all dat
is above it, and below it. On de top, ships
carrying men and women and children to
continents; below de waves, dead men and
women and children, dose who have died
by de way, floating by de cables which are
carrying words dat make and unmake
nations and men. Life and death are dere
togedder. Did you never tink of de sea in
dat way, Mr. Lucas, when you was not
studying domestic architecture and curios?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I have," said Lucas,
trying vainly to rise to the situation. A
man with a weapon he could have met and
fought any day, at a moment's notice, but
smooth words and soliloquies, how could
he meet them, though there was a hidden
meaning in every phrase, a subtle danger
indicated in every intonation?</p>

<p>"I should practise it den, Mr. Lucas,"
said Meyer gravely. "A little more tinking
and a little less action is de new brescription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
de doctors are giving to dis country." He
turned away from the window, after closing
it. He did not appear to notice the two
great holes in the glass which stared him in
the face.</p>

<p>"Den I shut my window tight, for fear
of dieves, Mr. Lucas," he went on, "and go
to my observatory, where we went de odder
day. I go up dose steps to my delescope,
and bring de stars widdin speaking distance.
Have you ever spoken wid de stars,
Mr. Lucas?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the burglar curtly.</p>

<p>"Ah, I taught not. Somehow you did
not give me dat imbression. You should
study de moon for a bekinning, Mr. Lucas.
It is a poor worn-out star of a sort. What
does it tell of? Of life run down, as many
men's are. But after all, de moon had its
day. It was not cut off in its prime, like
some men's lives are, Mr. Lucas, because of
a comet-like taught, or a meteor suggestion
of evil. A kreat science is astronomy, Mr.
Lucas. Do you not tink so?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas did not reply.</p>

<p>"Why do I speak of dese things, Mr.
Lucas?" said Meyer with increasing earnestness.
"Because you are young, very young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
dough you are nearly so old as me. I speak
of dem because you are wasting your life
entering my house in de mittle of de night
to take photokraphs, when de stars are
singing outside, and de world is calling for
de man who, as Dommas Carlyle says, is
not dere. What would Dommas Carlyle
have said if he had known dat you were
here all de time, taking photokraphs in Mr.
Adolph Meyer's villa&mdash;robbing Mr. Meyer,
widout de excuse of necessity?"</p>

<p>Lucas made an attempt to speak, but
Meyer stopped him. The little man's voice
rose, his eyes gleamed, his very stature
seemed to swell. The room was full of him.</p>

<p>"Be silent, sare," he said, with a gesture
of an emperor. "I am speaking! Listen!
I know what you will say: It is for sport
dat you do dis&mdash;sport dat eats up your race,
and makes men like me your master. You
take your gun and kill. See," pointing
through the window at a problematical
object. "Dat bird&mdash;dat beautiful white
gull. It is flying&mdash;seeking for food or its
mate. You shoot it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" shouted Lucas indignantly.</p>

<p>"You do. I know you do. You take
dat wonderful ding we call life&mdash;for sport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
You rob me. Dat is a smaller ding, but it
is sport also. Mein Gott! but you shall
rob and kill no more."</p>

<p>He struck a bell. Lucas backed to the
wall to be ready for emergencies. A little
sharp-featured man entered.</p>

<p>"Here he is, Mr. Marvell," said Meyer.
"I have got him red-handed and cold-souled."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir," said the little man
briskly, producing a pair of handcuffs. "I'll
take him across to Bournemouth, and we'll
have him up at the police court in the
morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Meyer did not appear to have heard
him. "Strange, is it not?" he resumed,
"dat you and I and Mr. Marvell, de clever
detective, should be here, Mr. Lucas? No,
I will call you by your broper name. Sir
Rubert Inkledree, I ask you to listen."</p>

<p>He took up a red volume from the table.</p>

<p>"Dis is a useful book," he said, as he
opened it. "We are all entered up here, all
our public appearances, dat is&mdash;not our midnight
photokraphings. Ah, here it is:</p>

<p>"'Sir Rubert Inkledree, seventh baronet,
born 1868, only son of sixth baronet and
Mary, daughter of Viscount Morecambe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Educated Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.
Owns twenty tousand acres. Address:
Inkledree Castle, Leicestershire; 57, Brook
Street, W. Clubs: Bachelor's, Boodle's, Turf.'</p>

<p>"Dat is fine&mdash;for a bekinning," continued
Meyer; "but what an end, Sir Rubert, in
dis room wid Mr. Meyer whom you have
robbed, and a detective, and de Bournemouth
Police Court in de morning. Dat
is not very fine. Now listen akain."</p>

<p>He turned over the leaves and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Adolph Meyer, born 1864. Financier.
Son of Jacob Meyer of Düsseldorf. M.A.
London University, Commander of de
Victorian Order, Chevalier of de Legion of
Honour. Address: 16, Lombard Street,
E.C., and St. George's Island, Bournemouth.'
Dat is all. Dere are no clubs and no acres.
I have de orders because I did service to
England and France. I am M.A. of London
University because, when I was a young
man behind de counter in de bank all day,
I worked for my dekree by night; and now
I am here, and you are where I like to put
you, Sir Rubert Inkledree."</p>

<p>"Bournemouth Police Station," suggested
Mr. Marvell, who was aching to get to
business.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bournemouth Police Station?" repeated
Mr. Meyer slowly. "No, Mr. Marvell; I
tink not. I am Master of Arts of London
University and reader of Blato, letting alone
de odder dings. He shall go free, and Mr.
Marvell, you will blease forket de incident.
I telekraft for you on Saturday. You
came, but dere was noding. Dat is what
you will report, please, at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"But you, Sir Rubert, you will not forket.
You will remember. You will neider kill
nor rob akain, because it is de wish of Mr.
Adolph Meyer, who makes you free instead
of sending you to de Police Station.</p>

<p>"Also, Sir Rubert, I suchest dat you give
up dat Club dat Mr. Marvell speaks of.
See, you have my Holbein in your pocket.
Take it, since you want it. Show it to your
friends, and say dat Mr. Meyer, who is M.A.
of London University, Commander, Chevalier
and tcheneral treamer, says dat dey had
better disbant, for de stars are singing, and
Mr. Marvell is watching."</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell folded up his handcuffs
methodically, and replaced them in his
pocket. He was too well trained to show
the intense disgust he felt at the turn the
proceedings had taken.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the burglar endeavoured to speak,
but once more Mr. Meyer commanded
silence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marvell will see you to your boat,
Sir Rubert," he said. "I drust dat you
will weigh my words well. It is not often
dat I say so many, and dey have caused
me some inconvenience to speak, as I am
not accustomed to spend Monday nights
in my marine villa. To be here I had dis
afternoon to postpone an interview wid de
Turkish Ambassador, which I have since
learnt by telekram from Constantinople has
been misconstrued. De Sultan will not sleep
much to-night, and in de morning newspapers
dere will be talk of drouble in de Balkan
States. Some peoples will be fearing war,
Sir Rubert, and all on account of you and
your midnight photokraphings. I wonder
what Dommas Carlyle would say to a mess
like dat. Goot night."</p>

<p>Mr. Meyer turned abruptly on his heels,
and left the room.</p>

<p>"Come along, Sir Rupert, please," said
Mr. Marvell. In the brilliant moonshine
they went along the terrace by the stone
dogs, and down the steps to the beach.
They found the boat by the trees.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did Mr. Meyer come to suspect
my errand?" said Ingletree suddenly.</p>

<p>The detective smiled a wan smile.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he replied, "I wasn't present
when you saw him on Saturday, but I think
that Mr. Meyer read you through as if you
were a book&mdash;printed in pretty big letters,
too. It was a rather thin tale, that about
the magazine article, and when you asked
to see round the house Mr. Meyer was certain
that you had some special object in
view. When you inquired after the miniatures
he knew what you were after, as the
papers had lately been full of the Holbein.
To make sure on the point he didn't show
it to you, and of course you asked to see
it. Then he telegraphed to Scotland Yard,
and they sent me."</p>

<p>"How did you find out who I was, and
why I wanted the miniature?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Marvell drily, "I'll tell
you that some day later on, Sir Rupert.
We shall probably meet again."</p>

<p>Then the baronet put out to sea, and
the detective went back to the Tuscan Villa.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following evening, at the meeting
of the Burglars' Club, the Secretary produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the Holbein miniature, and read a
letter from Sir Rupert Ingletree which
accompanied it. Then the President rose.</p>

<p>"My lords and gentlemen," he said, "we
have just heard the singular adventure which
has befallen one of our members. The
Holbein miniature is here, but only owing
to the goodwill of its owner. Sir Rupert
Ingletree is at liberty owing to the forbearance
of the same gentleman. Under the
circumstances I think we have no option
but to accept the resignation of Sir Rupert,
who does not appear to have acted with the
adroitness which is a necessary qualification
of our members. It may well be that you
or I would have done no better under similar
circumstances, but I need hardly remind you
that in this club we judge only by results,
and the results in this instance are not
satisfactory.</p>

<p>"There is a further matter to consider&mdash;a
message from Mr. Meyer, which demands
a reply. Colonel Altamont, as the <i>doyen</i> of
our club, we look to your premature grey
hairs for guidance."</p>

<p>Altamont rose amidst general applause.</p>

<p>"Your Grace, my lords and gentlemen,"
he began. "It is surely unnecessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ask for my opinion on the situation. Our
existence is now known to the outside world.
Twice has this detective, Marvell, been
within reach of us. Someone has betrayed
us, and I for one do not intend to rest until
I have traced that traitor. But this is not
the matter before us now.</p>

<p>"Though Mr. Meyer objects to sport, he
has behaved like a perfect sportsman.
(Hear, hear.) For his courtesy we wish to
express our hearty thanks and appreciation;
but for his suggestion that we should disband
we surely have one answer only, and
that is: Never, never, never."</p>

<p>The words were re-echoed on all sides.</p>

<p>"Our club would indeed have fallen on
degenerate days," continued Altamont, when
quiet was restored, "if the fact of its existence
being known were promptly to bring
about its end. Surely the fact that we are
watched should give an added zest to our
proceedings, which have been all too monotonously
serene. The knowledge that Scotland
Yard is acting, and that we carry our
personal liberty in our hands, should spur
us on to the Homeric deeds for the perpetration
of which we exist.</p>

<p>"Ingletree's postscript is pathetic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
vividly shows the present unbalanced state
of his mind. He asks whether we consider
that under Mr. Meyer's terms he is at liberty
to fish. My own feeling is that I would
have suffered a long period of incarceration
rather than have surrendered my right to
act as a free and independent Englishman;
but Ingletree, having accepted his liberty
on Mr. Meyer's stupendous terms, has surely
forfeited his right to again take life in any
form. If he so much as nets a minnow he
has no option but to surrender himself
forthwith at the Bournemouth Police Station.</p>

<p>"We all regret the loss of our once
brilliant member, but it is obvious from
Ingletree's behaviour during the last few
days that he is not the man he was when
he paid his entrance fee by the production
of&mdash;what was it, Mr. Secretary?&mdash;the Mace
of the House of Commons?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the Secretary. "That
was Mr. Henderson's fee. Sir Rupert Ingletree
entered with the Portland Vase, from
the British Museum."</p>

<p>"Ah, quite so. Thank you. And a very
smart bit of work it was, I remember. It
is regrettable that Sir Rupert could not be
here in person this evening to advance any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
extenuating circumstances; but as he is
probably under the surveillance of Scotland
Yard we appreciate his reason for adopting
the medium of the Postmaster-General for
communicating with us. I therefore propose
that Sir Rupert Ingletree's resignation
be accepted, and that, with the Holbein
picture, which we at once return to its owner
in accordance with our rule, we send a
letter expressing our appreciation of Mr.
Meyer's magnanimity, and our regret that
we are unable to disband. We can leave it
to our Secretary to couch this in the neat
epigrammatic style for which he is famed
in the Chancelleries of Europe."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VICTORIA CROSS.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me," said his Grace of Dorchester,
"that the Army has been abominably
neglected by us. On looking through
our archives, I do not come across the record
of a single military achievement. In the
Church and in the State, in Diplomacy and
Commerce, in Science, Art, and Literature,
our activities are marked, but we have
unaccountably left the Services alone. Our
enemies&mdash;if such there be&mdash;might unkindly
suggest that we have purposely refrained
from interfering with the most vigorous
portion of the community. To avoid this
reproach, and to make good the omission,
I therefore propose a series of three military
raids, the first to be immediately undertaken
by Mr. Maxwell-Pitt, who will have
the opportunity of renewing his subscription
at our next meeting by the production of
the last Victoria Cross bestowed by His
Majesty."</p>

<p>As the result of inquiries, Mr. Maxwell-Pitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
learned that the last Victoria Cross had
been given to Captain Sefton Richards, who
had rescued a wounded soldier from the
Somali, and, single-handed, had kept the
enemy at bay till support arrived.</p>

<p>"H'm!" reflected Maxwell-Pitt. "He'll
be a tough customer to tackle. It strikes me
that if I pull this off I shall have earned the
Blue Riband of the Club. I wonder where
the beggar is stationed?"</p>

<p>Further inquiries elicited the fact that
Captain Richards was at present spending
his well-earned leave with his sister, who
lived at Bamburn, in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>The next meeting of the Club had been
fixed for the 22nd of the month. On the
19th Maxwell-Pitt set out for Bamburn.</p>

<p>It was an ancient country town. Once
it had been an ecclesiastical centre&mdash;as its
minster still bore witness&mdash;but now it was
given up to the sale of sheep and the manufacture
of chocolate. In its outskirts was
a number of highly eligible residences, and
in one of these, the bequest of an uncle who
was the inventor of chocolate caramels, lived
Miss Richards.</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt learnt some of this from the
local directory, and some from the waiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at the inn, the night of his arrival; and on
the following morning he made his way to
the neighbourhood of Burgoyne Lodge&mdash;so
Miss Richards' house was styled&mdash;and sat
down on a seat thoughtfully provided by
the local district council. He waited there
a long time, apparently deeply absorbed in
the columns of a sporting paper, but in
reality rarely taking his eyes from the house.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock his patience was rewarded.
The gate opened, and two people
came out. The man&mdash;tall, straight, and
bronzed&mdash;was obviously Captain Richards,
the lady probably his sister. Mr. Maxwell-Pitt
saw them disappear along the road in
the direction of the town, and then he
approached the house to take in its bearings.
It was the last building on the road, and it
was closely surrounded by a belt of trees;
behind the trees were thick bushes. This
screen effectually concealed the house from
the road&mdash;for the inventor of chocolate
caramels had been a recluse by nature&mdash;so,
in order to obtain a better view of it,
Maxwell-Pitt got over the wall, and peered
through the bushes.</p>

<p>It was a solid Georgian dwelling, with two
windows on each side of the door. Which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
window should he attempt to force? The
end ones would be farthest from the hall,
and perhaps the safest. Or would it be
better to try the back? Confound it!</p>

<p>His eyes had been so intently fixed on
the house that he had omitted to notice an
occupant of the garden, but now he was
aware that a trimly and plainly gowned little
woman who was engaged in cutting flowers
had stopped in her work, and was watching
him. The position was ridiculous. What
excuse could he offer? He turned round,
got over the wall again, and walked quickly
away, with the conviction that he had made
a blunder, criminal in a professional, and
unpardonable even for an amateur.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, while he was walking
down the main street of the town, wondering
at the number of sheep the land contained&mdash;for
it was market day&mdash;he came face
to face with the same good-looking, dapper
little person he had seen in the grounds of
Burgoyne Lodge. She had appeared from
a side street, and no escape was open to
him. He fixed his eyes on the celebrated
Perpendicular architecture of the minster
tower, hoping to escape her attention, but,
to his surprise, she stopped him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pardon me, I think we have seen one
another before," she said slowly, and with
a marked foreign intonation.</p>

<p>"Of course we have," he replied, as he
took off his hat. "I remember the occasion
perfectly. How do you do?" Then he
added, unblushingly, "And how is your
sister?"</p>

<p>"I thank you," she answered. "My
sister would, no doubt, be quite well if I
had one. But please do not make romances.
I saw you this morning at Burgoyne Lodge.
I know what you want."</p>

<p>"The dickens you do!" he exclaimed in
blank amazement. "And pray what is it?"</p>

<p>"I think it is something that does not
belong to you," she said, her dark eyes
looking steadily at him.</p>

<p>"Indeed! And how do you know that?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders expressively.
"<i>Cela n'importe</i>," she answered. "If you
please, let us walk on so that we do not
draw attention. Yes, I know what you
want, and I think that I can assist you a
little."</p>

<p>"It's very good of you to suggest it,"
said Maxwell-Pitt as they walked along the
street; "and I'm sure I'm much obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to you. I'm not accustomed to this sort
of business, you know."</p>

<p>"You have made the same business once
before," she said.</p>

<p>"You are really remarkably well informed,"
he replied. "The least you can
do is to tell me how you come to know
these things."</p>

<p>"Do not waste the time," she said impatiently.
"I am Adèle, Miss Richards'
maid. She is in town with her brother,
the captain. They must not see us together.
When do you intend to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;" She
hesitated.</p>

<p>"To pick mushrooms, shall we call it?"
he answered.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;pick&mdash;mushrooms?" she repeated,
with a puzzled look. Then she smiled. "Ah,
I understand. Yes, when do you intend to
pick the fine mushrooms?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I know where they are, and
how to get them. If you assist me it will,
of course, make matters easy for me."</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, you are a thought-reader.
You anticipate my wishes. To-night, by all
means."</p>

<p>"Then I will see that one of the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
is left unlatched. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Meet me here
at this place at nine o'clock." With this
she turned abruptly round the corner they
were passing, and disappeared into a shop.</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt glanced ahead, and saw
Captain and Miss Richards approaching.
They might not have seen him with the
maid, for they were in earnest conversation.
Captain Richards only glanced casually at
him in passing.</p>

<p>"Well, this is what I call remarkable&mdash;simply
re-markable," said Maxwell-Pitt to
himself as he walked to his hotel. "How
on earth should she know of the V.C. business,
and, what is more, that I had to pay
my entrance fee by a previous burglary?
Who could have told her? I wonder why
any member should be so extremely anxious
to assist me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stop! Was it really a
member? There's that man Marvell&mdash;the
detective. He has been present at two
former burglaries&mdash;called in by accident,
certainly, but he has his eye on us, and
perhaps he now has some means of finding out
in advance the task set to members. The
remarkably obliging Adèle may be merely a
female detective. She may assist me to
get into the house, and show me where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
V.C. is, and then, when I get it, her friend
Marvell will appear. In that case Richards
and his sister are in the know, and this
apparently casual meeting just now, and
Adèle's annoyance, was pre-arranged to
throw me off the scent. It seems to me,
Maxwell-Pitt, that you'll have to be very
careful what you are about, or you'll be
landed to-night, and by a woman."</p>

<p>That evening he kept his appointment at
the street-corner. The maid was late. The
clocks had chimed the quarter before she
came, hot and breathless&mdash;not her cool,
nonchalant self of the morning.</p>

<p>"It has been so difficult to leave," she
explained. "Miss Richards would have me
to read to her after the dinner. Walter
Scott! And me dying all the time to be
here, Mr.&mdash;&mdash; What shall I call you?"</p>

<p>"Jones," said Maxwell-Pitt, "is a dreamy,
romantic name, very suitable for a mushroom
picker."</p>

<p>"Yes; Jones is a beautiful name," she
replied. "Have you decided to pick to-night,
Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"I should like to."</p>

<p>"You wish me to leave that window
open?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you will."</p>

<p>"And what do you give me, if you
please?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"What am I going to have of it all?"</p>

<p>"'All.' That is rather a big word for
the little mushroom I shall take away; but
if you would like some memento of the
occasion, what shall it be? A bracelet?"</p>

<p>"A bracelet? <i>Comment!</i> Absurd! With
my help, <i>m'sieu</i>, it will not be a little mushroom,
<i>point du tout</i>. For me myself I
demand fifty pounds."</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt stared at her blankly.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" she cried angrily.
"<i>Mais</i>, you are too stupid&mdash;more stupid
than the ordinary Englishman. Miss
Richards has some fine pearls, and her
diamonds are <i>magnifiques</i>, and I can give
them to you. This is not to be another
Wedderburn mistake."</p>

<p>"Ah, quite so&mdash;quite so," replied Maxwell-Pitt,
who was absolutely nonplussed by
the turn the conversation had taken. Then
he drew his bow at a venture. "Wedderburn
made a bit of a mistake, didn't he?"
he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him sharply. "'He.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Who's 'he'? You know precisely that I
speak of the burglary at Wedderburn 'Ouse
last week, where you were not very clever."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, of course. I understand,"
said Maxwell-Pitt.</p>

<p>"Of course you do understand. Why do
you so pretend to me? I knew it was you
when I saw you seeking round our 'ouse. I
saw you were big and dark, with a long
moustache, like the butler at Wedderburn
'Ouse said. How else did you think I could
have known you were a burglar? You are
to look at only like a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I see&mdash;I see," said Maxwell-Pitt, the
light at last breaking in upon him. "It
seems that I have done friend Marvell an
injustice."</p>

<p>"I do not know who your friend is, nor
what you talk about," said Mademoiselle
Adèle. "I must return at once. Is it to
be a bargain or not? Fifty pounds is little
compared to your share."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Maxwell-Pitt, "you
are not only an accomplished thought-reader,
but you appear to have the business
instinct strongly developed as well. You
can quite understand that when I planned
this&mdash;er&mdash;botanical expedition I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
anticipate such a drain on my resources. In
plain words, I haven't fifty pounds on me."</p>

<p>"You can get it, and come to-morrow
night instead."</p>

<p>"There will still be time," said Maxwell-Pitt
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course there will. Now I go. It
is settled?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll come to-morrow night and
bring fifty pounds with me."</p>

<p>"In gold sovereigns, please."</p>

<p>"In gold, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Good. And I'll have the jewellery
ready. The pearl necklace cost more than a
thousand sovereigns. There will be no need
to take anything else, I hope. That big
mushroom should satisfy you enough."</p>

<p>"Amply. I don't want any more jewels,
but where does Captain Richards keep his
decorations&mdash;his Victoria Cross, for instance?"</p>

<p>"You don't want that?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"It is only worth a few centimes&mdash;not
half a franc, they tell me."</p>

<p>"Never mind its value. I am a collector
of such trifles, and want this specimen
particularly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won it in battle. It would be cruel&mdash;abominable&mdash;to
take it. You cannot have
it."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Adèle, your scruples do you
credit; but, after all, are mushroom-pickers
the people to talk about scruples? Here
you are planning what is, in plain English,
the robbery of your employer, so why stick
at a trifle like that?"</p>

<p>"<i>Écoutez</i>, Mr. Jones. You are only a
burglar, so your opinion is no matter, but I
shall tell you why I do this thing. I come
to your country to get riches. I am clever,
but there are no riches, even for clever people,
in my own valley of the Durance. First I
was maid to one lady with a title so long,"
and she extended her arms to their full
width. "I was 'appy. Then I met an
aëronaut&mdash;you understand, one who makes
ascensions in a balloon&mdash;who talked my
language like myself. He persuades me to
leave my place and marry him. I was idiot
to do so. Then one day he goes up in his
balloon at&mdash;what you call it?&mdash;Birmingham,
for a brief voyage. But he disappears in
the clouds. He sends me postcard from
Ostend to tell me that he is landed all-right.
Then I never found him again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused dramatically. Maxwell-Pitt
felt that something was demanded of him,
and hastened to murmur some words of
sympathy, but she did not listen.</p>

<p>"Then I took a place again as lady's
maid," she went on. "There was trouble
over some jewels. They blamed me. Bah!
I was innocent. But they say 'No,' and
'You go at once,' and 'No character.' So
I am alone in England, with no money and
<i>mon mari</i> gone. I come here, and I think
this lady so kind to take me without a
character written. Then I find the ones who
have the characters written will not stay
with her&mdash;not one month&mdash;so that is why
she takes me. She is black slave-driver,
and her temper&mdash;<i>mon Dieu</i>, it is dis-graceful!
It is a horrible time here. Then there is
Alphonse, who is waiter at the Élysée Palace,
who wants me to marry him and assist him
to found a restaurant, and I must continually
tell him 'Wait.'</p>

<p>"When I see you, Mr. Jones, I see my
way to escape from it all. It came at one
jump&mdash;the thought, 'I will help him, and
he will give me fifty gold sovereigns, and I
shall go to Belgium at once. My 'usband
is either dead, or I find him and tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
what I think of him, and get a divorce,
and then return and marry the good Alphonse,
who adores me.' So you see that
I am no common thief. Bah! As for
madame's jewellery, <i>ça ne fait rien</i>. She
is rich. I shall be glad to have annoyed
her. But at once I tell you, you shall not
have the Victoria Medal. That is not to
be. Captain Richards is the only man in
this miserable country who has been kind
to me. And he is a brave soldier. I shall
not permit that you annoy him."</p>

<p>"I promise to return it."</p>

<p>"Then for why do you take it?"</p>

<p>"That is my affair. I will bring the
fifty pounds to-morrow night, but I must
have the cross whether you help me to get
it or not. Where does he keep it?"</p>

<p>"Keep it? <i>Attendez.</i> Oh, I know. In
the strong box locked in his bedroom. He
is a man to shoot certain, and he always
has his pistol to hand. You will give me
the money instantly you are in the 'ouse,
for if you go upstairs you will be a dead
man at once. I tell you so myself."</p>

<p>"That is an extremely unpleasant prospect.
I must see my lawyer&mdash;my <i>notaire</i>,
mademoiselle&mdash;in the morning, and arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
my affairs. Which window will you unlatch
for me?"</p>

<p>"The one at the front, the nearest to
where you stood when I saw you. If you
will come at one o'clock I will be in the room
with the beautiful pearls. Now I must fly.
<i>Bon soir, cher</i> Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>On the following morning Maxwell-Pitt
paid his hotel bill and went up to town.
In the evening he returned with his bicycle,
getting out at the station beyond Bamburn.
At a few minutes to one o'clock he entered
the grounds of Burgoyne Lodge, and made
his way stealthily to the window fixed on.
It open noiselessly, and he clambered through.
Mademoiselle Adèle was not there. Perhaps
she was reading Sir Walter Scott to Miss
Richards. He would wait for half an hour,
at any rate, before making any move. Perhaps
Adèle had thought better of her determination
about the cross, and would bring
it with her rather than risk trouble.</p>

<p>He sat down and mused. A queer life,
that of a burglar. Reminiscences of detective
tales came back to him. He thought of
Sherlock Holmes. The doings of the Burglars'
Club would have puzzled him at first.
Then there was his great predecessor, Poe's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Dupin, the detective of The Murders in
the Rue Morgue, of The Mystery of Marie
Rogêt, and The Purloined Letter. Ah, The
Purloined Letter! They were searching for
that all over, probing every inch of space
in the house for it, and there it was all the
time, underneath their noses, hanging in a
card-rack beneath the mantelpiece. Maxwell-Pitt
rose and flashed his light over the
mantelpiece. There was the usual assortment
of odds and ends, but the V.C. was
not there. No; it was too much to expect.
Where did Richards keep it? Adèle had
hesitated before replying that it was in the
strong box in his bedroom. It might be&mdash;or
it might not. Here, at any rate, were
obvious traces of its owner&mdash;his letters and
pipe on a side table, his service magazines
on the chair. If the V.C. wasn't on the
mantelpiece, it might be elsewhere in the
room.</p>

<p>There was a bookcase with a cupboard
and drawers. He opened the bookcase, but
closed it quickly at the sight of the serried
ranks of the "Encyclopædia Britannica."
He had no better luck in the cupboard, but
in the first drawer he pulled out, his eye was
at once caught by two small cases. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
eagerly opened one, to find the South African
Medal, but in the second&mdash;ye gods! It was
the Victoria Cross!</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt's fingers closed over it. At
this moment the door opened gently.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" whispered a voice.</p>

<p>By this time he had moved to the table.
He turned his light on again.</p>

<p>Adèle was there&mdash;pale and excited. From
a pocket which she must have specially constructed
she produced a large case. She
opened it, disclosing a necklace of large
pearls.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she whispered. "Where
are the fifty sovereigns?"</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt drew out a bag and gave
it to her. She opened it, and looked at the
contents, then put it in her pocket.</p>

<p>"Now go," she said. "<i>Vite!</i>"</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt moved towards the window.
"I don't want this," he said, pointing to
the case.</p>

<p>"You don't want it?" she exclaimed in
astonishment. For a moment they stood
there facing one another. Then a sudden
thought struck her. She went to the bookcase,
opened the drawer, and saw only one
case there.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are more clever than I thought,"
she said. "I wished to take these away
upstairs to-night, but the Captain he remained
here late, and then madame wanted
me. You have got the medal, but you shall
not go away with it. Give it back to me."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="379" height="500" alt="Man in robe carrying a candle being watched by a man and a woman" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE WAS WALKING IN HIS SLEEP, CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_250">p. 250.</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt shook his head.</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed in anger. "You will
not? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> then I sound the alarm."</p>

<p>"How will you account for this?" said
Maxwell-Pitt, pointing to the case on the
table.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I do not care," she
answered. "Give me the medal, or I ring."</p>

<p>Her hand clutched the bell rope. "Shall
I ring or not?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Again there was a sound at the door.
Once more he turned off his light. The
door opened wide, and Captain Richards
entered, carrying a lighted candle in his
hand.</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt and Adèle stood there transfixed.
The light shone full on them, but
Captain Richards took no heed of them.
His eyes were fixed, staring into space. He
was walking in his sleep, conscious of nothing
that was going on around him. He placed
his candle on the side table, sat down in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
easy chair, drew the book-rest towards him,
and leaned back, staring vacantly at the
pages of the open book.</p>

<p>Adèle released the bell rope and held a
warning finger to her lips. She stepped
lightly to Maxwell-Pitt. "Sh! it is dangerous
to awaken him," she whispered.
"Once they awakened my cousin suddenly
when he walked like that in his sleep. He
was never the same here again," and she
tapped her forehead. "Now go at once,
but softly."</p>

<p>He clambered out, and then looked back
through the window into the room.</p>

<p>Adèle picked up the jewel case and put
it into her pocket. There she touched the
bag of gold. She pulled it out, looked at it
for a moment, then stepped hastily to the
window and flung it from her into the
garden. She leaned out, and whispered,
vindictively, "Take your money. I shall
help the police. They shall catch you before
the clock is round."</p>

<p>Then she stepped gently to the door.
It closed behind her, and the sleep-walker
was alone in the room.</p>

<p>Maxwell-Pitt picked up the bag of gold,
and then cycled thirty miles. He caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
an early train to London, and that evening
he renewed his subscription to the Burglars'
Club by exhibiting the Victoria Cross lately
bestowed on Captain Sefton Richards by His
Majesty.</p>

<p>On the following day, to his great astonishment,
Captain Richards received the cross
in a registered postal packet, with no word
to explain the reason of its temporary
absence; and a few days later a larger
postal packet came for Mademoiselle Adèle,
which, on being opened, disclosed to her
enraptured eyes fifty sovereigns.</p>

<p>Thus did Maxwell-Pitt attempt to atone
for the burglary he had perpetrated. "After
all," he thought, "the only person who will
have been seriously inconvenienced by the
transaction is the balloonist in Belgium&mdash;and
he deserves it."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LAST CHRONICLE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert Brown</span>, second Baron Lothersdale,
was generally regarded as being the best
business man in the country. His talent for
affairs was doubtless hereditary, as his father
had successfully kept a big emporium before
seeking the parliamentary honours which led
to higher things. His son, in his turn,
entered Parliament, and quickly ran the
gamut of two under-secretaryships and the
Cabinet. The Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland
and the Governor-Generalship of India
would undoubtedly have been his, but for
the impossibility of associating Brown's Bayswater
Bazaar with those regal positions.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the last of six successive
schemes for the reorganisation of the British
Army had fallen to the parliamentary floor
and broken in pieces, it was felt that there
was only one man who could tackle the
matter, and bring it to a successful issue.
Lord Lothersdale's tenure of the Postmaster-Generalship
was remembered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
pride by a grateful nation. Under his
management the reply-postcard business,
which had hitherto dragged and lost money,
had become a popular and remunerative
department, while his penny-in-the-slot form
of application for Government annuities was
an innovation as brilliant in conception as
it was profitable in results.</p>

<p>When the country learnt that to Lord
Lothersdale had been entrusted the task of
reforming the Army it heaved a sigh of
content, for it knew that the work was now
as good as done; and when the news reached
the Continent the officers of the Great
General Staff of the German Army were
noticed to wear a sad and pensive look
unusual to them.</p>

<p>To accomplish the work that in the past
twenty years alone had cost thousands of
lives and millions of money, besides incidentally
destroying six first-class parliamentary
reputations, Lord Lothersdale retired
to Moors, his Berkshire seat, and there,
in his study overlooking the deer park, he
accumulated his evidence and dictated his
Report.</p>

<p>From time to time paragraphs appeared
in the papers that Lord Lothersdale was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
busy at his work, or that he was making
progress therein, and at last word went
round that he was now putting the final
touches to his Report, which would be laid
before the Cabinet the following week.</p>

<p>Then it was that his Grace of Dorchester
decided that Mr. Drummond Eyre must show
the same Report at the next meeting of the
Burglars' Club, if he wished to continue his
membership thereof.</p>

<p>George Drummond Eyre was a Leicestershire
man, an ex-guardsman, and a shooter
of big game. He received the news of his
mission without comment, and proceeded to
make himself acquainted with the habits of
his lordship of Lothersdale. He was still
pursuing these investigations when he read
in the <i>Morning Mail:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Lord Lothersdale is just completing his work
of reorganising the British Army on paper with
the thoroughness which we associate with his name.
Not content with revising the duties attached to
the highest offices, with altering the length of service,
and the pay of officer and private, his lordship
is actually winding up with suggestions for
a new full-dress uniform for our soldiers. The
traditional red is to be discarded, and hues more
in keeping with the aesthetic taste of the age will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
supplant it, in the hope of attracting a superior
class of men to the army. We hear that Mr. Bower,
the eminent tailor, was last week at Moors, and
that to-day a member of his staff will arrive there
with sample uniforms for his lordship's inspection.
History is in making at Moors."</p></div>

<p>"Good!" said Eyre, with obvious satisfaction,
as he read this paragraph. "This
fits in well. I'm in luck's way."</p>

<p>That was at nine o'clock in the morning.
At ten o'clock he drove up to Mr. Bower's
well-known establishment, and sent in a
card on which was printed in unostentatious
letters, "Mr. Luke Sinnott," and in the
bottom corner "Criminal Investigation Dept.,
New Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was shown into Mr.
Bower's private room.</p>

<p>Mr. Bower was a ponderous gentleman.
In a higher station of life he would have
been a Dean.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Sinnott?"
he inquired, eyeing his visitor over the top
of his gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>"I have come on important business,
sir," said the pseudo-Sinnott. He went
back to the door, and closed it cautiously,
then deposited his hat and gloves on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
table with a precision which impressed the
tailor with a sense of deep mystery.</p>

<p>"I think you have just been to Moors,"
he said, after these preliminaries.</p>

<p>"That is so," replied the tailor, with
unnatural indifference.</p>

<p>"And one of your people is going there
to-day with some sample uniforms?"</p>

<p>"I am going there to-day with a sample
uniform."</p>

<p>"Quite so. You are aware that Lord
Lothersdale is working on a very important
report?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>Mr. Sinnott came a step nearer to the
tailor, and dropped his voice to an impressive
whisper.</p>

<p>"What I am going to tell you," he continued,
"is in the strictest confidence. A
Continental Power that shall be nameless,
but whose identity you, as a man of the
world, will be able to guess, is moving heaven
and earth to get to know what that report
contains. It is certain that whatever Lord
Lothersdale suggests will be carried out by
our government, and this will immediately
influence the military policy of the Power
in question. Moreover, there are some secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
portions of this report which will never be
made public. Therefore this foreign power
is striving to get sight of it before it leaves
Lord Lothersdale's hands.</p>

<p>"One spy has already been detected and
warned off by our man who is established in
the village, but we have just learnt that
another agent has obtained admission to the
house itself, by taking service as a footman.
On a previous occasion we alarmed Lord
Lothersdale, without any real grounds, as it
eventually turned out, and we should not
care to repeat the incident. It is therefore
essential that I, who know this man, should
have the opportunity of seeing if he really
is there, without anyone&mdash;not even his lordship&mdash;knowing
who I am. With your assistance
this will be possible; and I have come
from Scotland Yard to ask you to allow me
to go with you to Moors to-day, ostensibly
as connected with your firm. If you will
assist us in this matter you will not find us
ungrateful. Scotland Yard does not forget,
and some day it may be in our power to be
of use to you. In the meantime, you will
have done your country a great service."</p>

<p>Mr. Bower was considerably impressed
by this speech. He had come back from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Moors full of importance. He was most
certainly assisting in preserving the integrity
of the empire, and it was quite in keeping
with this feeling that he should take part
in the international complication outlined by
his visitor. He appeared to weigh the matter
judicially for a few minutes. Then he said
solemnly, "We will give you our co-operation
in this affair, Mr. Sinnott."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Bower," said the
"detective."</p>

<p>So at one o'clock that afternoon Mr.
Bower, accompanied by his new assistant,
took train for Moors. In another compartment
travelled a sample corporal of the
British Army, who was to show off the
uniform which Mr. Bower had designed
under Lord Lothersdale's instructions.</p>

<p>It was a two-hours' journey, but Mr.
Sinnott found it all too short in Mr. Bower's
improving society, for that gentleman expounded
views on life from a new standpoint.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, "things are not what
they used to be. Gentlemen&mdash;noblemen,
especially, I regret to state&mdash;do not display
that intelligent attention to dress which they
used to, even within my own recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Lord Lothersdale is a notable exception,
but enumerate any other statesmen you like,
and if left to their own unaided judgment&mdash;I
say it with all due deference&mdash;they
would go to pieces. I assure you, upon my
honour, at the end of six months you would
be liable to mistake any one of them for a
foreigner. You would scarcely think it, Mr.
Sinnott, but no less than five members of
the present Government are too busy to
give a thought to their dress at all."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Mr.
Sinnott.</p>

<p>"I do. 'Bower,' they say, 'keep your
eye on us, and whenever you think that
we are gettin' shabby make us some new
clothes, and we will wear them. We leave
it all to you.' It is flatterin', sir, I suppose,
to have such reliance placed in your judgment,
but it demonstrates the absence of&mdash;shall
I term it proper self-respect?&mdash;which
is deplorable, absolutely deplorable. It has
made me a firm believer in the degeneration
of the race.</p>

<p>"Of course, to keep the Cabinet well-dressed
is the principal object of my existence,
and I flatter myself that under my
superintendence the present Cabinet will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
compare favourably in taste and style with
any previous one. But it is anxious, even
harassin' work to decide what particular
cut, colour, and texture will most suitably
harmonise with each individual temperament.
They cannot afford the time for
interviews, so I have to anticipate the
movements of ministers, and go out of my
way to meet them. I track them down, as
it were, and make my observations in the
street, as best I can. Would you believe it,
Mr. Sinnott, I was one day actually arrested
for suspiciously followin' the Secretary of
State for India? His trousers were positively
baggin' at the knees. I couldn't take my
eyes off them, and one of your smart young
constables took me to Bow Street. Most
humiliatin', I call it; and all because of
my devotion to duty and the honour of the
nation."</p>

<p>"Shocking," said Mr. Sinnott. "I sympathise
with you, Mr. Bower. I should like
to know the name of that constable."</p>

<p>"His name was Simpson&mdash;Archibald
Simpson," replied the tailor.</p>

<p>Mr. Sinnott made a note of the name,
and Mr. Bower continued:</p>

<p>"But, as I previously observed, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Lothersdale is a horse of another colour, if
I may make use of such an expression.
It is an inspiration to meet him. He is the
busiest gentleman in England&mdash;bar none&mdash;but
he is never too busy for a try-on or
for a consultation. He is gifted, sir. He has
ideas that would amaze you. The single-breasted
frock-coat was his creation. What
do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"You do astonish me, Mr. Bower. I
had no idea of it."</p>

<p>"I knew you had not&mdash;that is where the
greatness of the man comes in. It is his
conception, and he is fully aware that the
credit of it is attributed to me&mdash;but he
does not mind. There is no petty jealousy
of the profession about him. Then, silk
breeches for evenin' wear. That is another
of his grand ideas. You must have silk
breeches if you visit at Moors, or you do
not receive a second invitation. He is drastic
in his methods, is my lord&mdash;a regular Roman.
Mark my words, Mr. Sinnott, if the fashion
takes it will be owin' to the influence of
Lord Lothersdale, and once get the nation
into silk breeches, and you do not know to
what heights it may attain. It will be the
beginnin' of a new era, the like of which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
man livin' has known. I only hope I shall
be here to witness its dawn."</p>

<p>Mr. Bower's eyes glistened, and his cheeks
flushed in anticipation. Even Mr. Sinnott
caught a little of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was half-past three when they reached
Moors. Lord Lothersdale could not see them
until after dinner. At that moment a Japanese
Surgeon-General was with him, explaining
how they managed their field hospitals
in the Far East. He had come by special
permission of the Mikado, and had to return
to the seat of war by the six o'clock train.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the corporal was arrayed
in the proposed new uniform for the Line&mdash;a
taking arrangement in heliotrope, the
outcome of Lord Lothersdale's creative
genius and Mr. Bower's executive ability.</p>

<p>At nine-thirty they were admitted into
Lord Lothersdale's study. The great man
was in a genial mood, the result, no doubt,
of an instructive afternoon and a good dinner.</p>

<p>He walked round the corporal, and inspected
him critically.</p>

<p>"By Jove! Bower," he said at last,
"you've done the trick. Capital! And
your idea of primrose facings was quite
right, after all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad that you approve of it, my
lord," said the beaming tailor.</p>

<p>"I do. And the country will, too.
There'll be some recruiting when this gets
out." Then he knitted his brows. "I
think the cuffs are a shade too deep, though.
I'm sure they are. But half-an-inch&mdash;no,
a quarter&mdash;will put it right."</p>

<p>"A quarter-of-an-inch off the cuff facin's.
Make a note of that," said Mr. Bower to
his assistant, who had his pocket-book ready.</p>

<p>"You'll have it done by breakfast time,
please," said Lord Lothersdale, "so that
I can see how it looks by daylight. A
photographer will be here, as I want some
coloured prints for the Appendix."</p>

<p>Then the little deputation withdrew.
The whole interview had not occupied more
than five minutes, and most of that time
the tailor's assistant had been taking his
bearings, and trying to locate the report.
That was surely it&mdash;a business-like foolscap
volume on the desk. The secretary was
writing in it when they entered, and later
on he had carefully put it in the top left-hand
drawer. The assistant man&oelig;uvred
round to the desk during the interview, and
after taking particulars of the alterations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
required, he laid down his notebook, and
deliberately left it there.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the morning, when the
whole household was presumably fast asleep,
Mr. Bower's assistant suddenly remembered
that he had left his notebook downstairs,
and decided to recover it at once rather than
wait till morning. He therefore made his
way cautiously to Lord Lothersdale's study.
He accomplished the return journey without
any untoward event happening; but he
brought back with him, in addition to the
notebook, a manuscript volume, which he
deposited in his handbag.</p>

<p>The alterations in the cuff facings were
duly made by breakfast time. At nine
o'clock Lord Lothersdale approved of the
result. By nine-fifteen the corporal had
been photographed in several attitudes&mdash;one
of which now adorns the recruiting
posters&mdash;and by nine-thirty the party was
driving to the railway station, incidentally
meeting a troop of Hussars on the
march to Moors for purposes of the Appendix.</p>

<p>"That is what I call business," said Mr.
Bower, as they took their seats in the train
at the last moment. "No time is lost in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
dealin' with Lord Lothersdale. I hope that
you got to know all you wanted."</p>

<p>"All," replied Mr. Sinnott. "We have
evidently been misinformed, for the man
I wanted is not there. If we'd made a fuss
about it to Lord Lothersdale we should have
been sorry. As it is, we are very much
obliged to you, Mr. Bower, and we shan't
forget it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The next business," said the Hon. Sec.
at the Burglars' Club meeting that same
evening, "is the payment by Mr. Drummond
Eyre of his subscription for the next two
years by the production of Lord Lothersdale's
Report on the Army."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Eyre, producing a
manuscript volume.</p>

<p>A subdued murmur of applause ran round.</p>

<p>The President took up the book and
glanced at it. "This seems to be in order,"
he said, turning to the end. "Lothersdale
signs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly. The door had
opened without any warning, and a little
sharp-featured individual entered, followed
by half a dozen other men.</p>

<p>"In the name of the King," said the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
comer, "I arrest George Drummond Eyre
for feloniously stealing, taking, and carrying
away certain papers, namely a Report, the
property of the Right Honourable Gilbert
Brown, Baron Lothersdale, and I arrest all
others present as accessories."</p>

<p>Members rose to their feet, and simultaneously
made a move towards the door,
with the evident intention of resisting the
intrusion.</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell&mdash;for it was he&mdash;held up his
hand warningly. "There are more men outside,"
he said. "Resistance is useless."</p>

<p>"Where's your authority for all this?"
demanded the Secretary.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said Marvell, pulling out a
bundle of papers from a capacious pocket.
"Here are the warrants. 'Mr. George
Drummond Eyre,'" he called out, reading
from the pile. "Here you are, sir. 'The
Duke of Dorchester.' Here, your Grace.
'The Earl of Ribston.' Here, my lord.
'Mr. Hilton,' 'Major Anstruther,'" and so
on through the list of members. "You will
find these quite in order, I think. Now,
gentlemen, if you please. I have concluded
that you would prefer to ride. Thompson,
fetch the hansoms round."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop!" called out Ribston. "What
are you going to do with us?"</p>

<p>"Take you to Vine Street Station."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. We're not criminals."</p>

<p>"You can argue that out with the magistrate
to-morrow, my lord," said the detective.
"Here are the warrants, and I'm going to
execute them. If the proceedings are not
in order, you can claim reparation in the
usual way. Now, gentlemen, please. If you
will give your word to come quietly you
will save time and trouble."</p>

<p>"Does the Home Secretary know of
this?" asked the Duke.</p>

<p>"We don't report police court details to
the Home Secretary," said Marvell, acidly.
"No, sir, he doesn't."</p>

<p>"Then I demand to see him before these
warrants are executed," said Dorchester.</p>

<p>"Impossible, your Grace," said Marvell,
who twice before had been defrauded of his
legitimate prey. Not again was he going
to run the risk of undue favour staying the
hand of Justice. He had now in his possession
a batch of prisoners so notable that next
day his name would ring from one end of
the world to the other. "Impossible," was
the obvious reply.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I write a letter?" asked the
Duke.</p>

<p>"No, your Grace, you may not," replied
Marvell firmly. "You are now a prisoner,
and you will please come with me without
more delay. Now, gentlemen, will you pass
your words to come quietly? You can
cause trouble if you like, but we are more
than equal to you in numbers, so there
could only be one end to the matter."</p>

<p>Dorchester consulted Ribston and the
Secretary. The others nodded reluctant
consent. Word was given, and they passed
out. The house doors were flung open, and
they filed into the street, where a dozen
hansoms were in line, a dozen policemen in
waiting, and a small but inevitable crowd
had collected.</p>

<p>"Ask Colonel Altamont to see the Home
Secretary at once," said Dorchester to his
butler, as he was helped into his coat.</p>

<p>The old man stood there petrified by the
horror of the proceedings. He had been in
the family for generations. Three Dukes of
Dorchester had he known in all their glory.
Kings, Queens, and Potentates had flitted
in and out of the ducal mansion with his
masters, and now he had lived to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
last of the line taken away like a thief, for
some terrible crime. He heard the Duke's
words to him, but they conveyed no impression
to his brain. He did not reply.
The police, the bustle in the hall, the crowd
outside, the driving away of the prisoners,
all was as a horrible nightmare to him.</p>

<p>"His Grace said you were to tell Colonel
Altamont to go at once to the Home Secretary,
Mr. Bolton," said the footman, who
had held the Duke's coat.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Bolton, waking from his
stupor. He caught hold of a hat, and ran
out of the house.</p>

<p>Altamont had not been able to be present
that evening. Business of importance had
detained him, and he had only just got back
to his rooms when Bolton turned up. He
started off at once to the Home Secretary,
and after exasperating interviews with a
footman, a butler, and a private secretary,
was at length admitted to the presence of
that high personage, who was in his dressing
gown, and considerably annoyed at this
interruption to his slumbers.</p>

<p>The Colonel explained the situation.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the Home Secretary
when he had finished.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"All, sir!" cried the indignant Colonel.
"Dorchester, Ribston, Anstruther, and a
dozen others, arrested by your policemen,
and you ask 'Is that all?'"</p>

<p>"Colonel," said the Minister, emphasising
his remarks with his forefinger in Old Bailey
style, "Dorchester, Ribston, and the whole
lot should have known better&mdash;very much
better. They've had their sport, and now
they've got to pay for it. I can't interfere.
If the jury recommend them to mercy I'll
give them the benefit of any doubt, and will
save them from hanging; but that's all I
can promise. Now have a whiskey and
soda, and go to bed."</p>

<p>Altamont declined the whiskey and soda,
and left the Minister indignantly. On his
doorstep he was promptly arrested by
Marvell, who had a couple of warrants left
over after depositing his prisoners at Vine
Street. The last warrant could not be
served that night, as the member in question
happened to be visiting a friend in Nova
Zembla.</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell took good care that the news
of the arrest of the Duke of Dorchester, the
Earl of Ribston, and the other more or less
distinguished members of the Burglars' Club,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
should be at once communicated to the Press
in case some influential friend should intervene
at the last moment, and once more
defraud him of his due. The morning's
papers were full of the news, with the result
that the Marlborough Street Police Court
was filled to overflowing long before the
proceedings commenced. The Peerage, the
Diplomatic Service, the Commons, the Army
and the Navy, the Stage and Sport, were
well represented. Every inch of space, including
the bench itself, was filled, and
fair women and brave men were turned
away.</p>

<p>Half a dozen ordinary cases were quickly
disposed of. Then the extraordinary case
was called, and the spectators involuntarily
rose to their feet as the Burglars filed into
the dock, and took their stand two deep
behind the brass rail. A murmur of sympathy
went round as they stood there&mdash;some
of them obviously interested in the
proceedings, others apparently bored by
them&mdash;all well-groomed, straight set-up men,
though their evening dress looked incongruous
enough in the daylight, and their
crumpled shirt-fronts did not show to
advantage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one the prisoners' names were
called. One by one the prisoners answered.</p>

<p>Then counsel for the Crown stood up,
and having stated that the charge against
the prisoners was that of stealing a Report,
the property of Lord Lothersdale, he opened
his case and called the first witness&mdash;Mr.
Bower.</p>

<p>Mr. Bower entered the box, and adjusted
his pince-nez with extreme nicety. Under
counsel's lead he detailed how the so-called
Sinnott had introduced himself.</p>

<p>"I had no doubt at all as to his <i>bona
fides</i>," said the tailor, lingering lovingly
over the Latin words; "but immediately
afterwards I had a wire from Moors asking
me to postpone my visit to his lordship.
I rang up Scotland Yard to inform Mr.
Sinnott of the alteration, and learnt that
he was unknown there. Then I informed
the authorities of the whole matter, with
the result that our original intention was
followed, and every facility allowed to Mr.
Sinnott for carry out his plans."</p>

<p>"Done! By Jove!" gasped Eyre.</p>

<p>Lord Lothersdale's secretary then gave
evidence that the Report now produced in
court was the property of his lordship.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," he added smilingly, "the
real Report is still at Moors. This one,
though signed for the present purpose by
Lord Lothersdale, has no value. It was
drawn up three years ago by a former Secretary
of State for War," he explained.</p>

<p>Then there was formal evidence of the
arrest from Mr. Marvell, who was allowed
to speak at length.</p>

<p>"For some time past, your worship," he
said, "we have been aware of the existence
of what is called 'The Burglars' Club,'
composed of noblemen and gentlemen such
as your worship sees before you. Our information
was derived in the first instance
from a discharged servant of one of the
members. In revenge for his dismissal he
told us of proceedings he had witnessed at
his master's house on one occasion, when he
was concealed behind a curtain in the room.</p>

<p>"He furnished us with a list of members,
and ever since then we have had them
under observation. These gentlemen amuse
themselves by stealing articles of great
value or of public interest. We know for
a fact that at one time and another they
have obtained unlawful possession of the
Koh-i-noor Diamond, the Mace of the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of Commons, Lord Illingworth's Black Pearl,
an ounce of Radium from Professor Blyth's
laboratory, and even the Great Seal of
the United Kingdom itself."</p>

<p>"Good old burglars!" called out an
admiring listener at the back of the court.</p>

<p>"Silence!" shouted an indignant usher.</p>

<p>"We have waited, your worship, until we
could interfere successfully, knowing that
it was only a question of time for us to do
so. I have twice been called in on the
occasion of a burglary committed by a
member of the club, and in each case&mdash;of
course against my wishes&mdash;no charge
was made. In this particular instance the
member walked straight into the trap."</p>

<p>This closed the case for the Crown, and
counsel proceeded to urge the seriousness
of the offence, and the necessity for a severe
sentence, not only as a just punishment,
but as an example.</p>

<p>Counsel for the prisoners now rose. He
was the famous Mr. Spiller, who had earned
the well-deserved sobriquet of "The prisoner's
pal."</p>

<p>He stood up with a twinkle in his eye,
and an air of confidence that gladdened
the hearts of the ladies on the bench.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your worship," he began, "I shall not
detain the Court more than a very few
minutes, for I admit all the evidence that
has been tendered. The last witness gave
a list of articles illegally taken by my clients.
If he wishes, I will add to the list another
half-dozen instances of equal importance."</p>

<p>"Bravo! Go it, Spiller!" called out the
sympathiser at the back, whose sporting instincts
were too strong for him. This time
he was surrounded by ushers and ejected.</p>

<p>"But, sir," continued counsel, when quiet
had again been restored, "I must emphasize
a point which has been completely and
unaccountably lost sight of by the prosecution.
Not one of the articles taken by
my clients has been retained by them for
longer than twenty-four hours. Within that
period every article has been restored to its
owner. Restitution has always been made,
and compensation given whenever compensation
was necessary.</p>

<p>"We in this court have many times had
occasion to admire the abilities of Mr.
Marvell as a detective, but I would now
suggest that he should go through a course
of Stephen's 'Commentaries' in order to
obtain a little knowledge of the law which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
he is in the constant habit of putting into
force. I cannot too strongly denounce the
unwarrantable action of Scotland Yard in
submitting my clients to the indignity of
an arrest and these proceedings upon the
evidence in their possession. They must
know&mdash;or their office-boy or charwoman is
capable of instructing them in the fact&mdash;that
by English law no person can be guilty
of larceny who does not intend permanently
to deprive its owner of the article of which
he has gained possession. Mere conversion,
though accompanied by trespass, is nothing
more than a civil wrong, for which possibly
my clients might be liable to a farthing
damages.</p>

<p>"Surely," concluded Mr. Spiller, "life is
dull and prosaic enough without this high-handed
and unwarranted attempt of Scotland
Yard to extinguish an original, if not
laudable, effort on the part of my clients
to add to the dexterity and the gaiety of
the nation. Your worship, I submit there
is no evidence against my clients, and ask
for the immediate discharge of the prisoners."</p>

<p>As Mr. Spiller spoke, the countenance
of the prosecuting counsel was observed
to become exceedingly gloomy, while Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Marvell's complexion turned distinctly
green.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;MR. MARVELL .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. THANKED THE COMPANY FOR THE GIFT,
WHICH HE WOULD TREASURE.&quot;</span> <div class='attrib'>(<i><a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a></i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Then the magistrate spoke. He began
with the usual reprimand to the spectators,
and the usual threat to have the place
cleared if the ordinary decencies of a Court
of Justice were not maintained. Then he
turned to the prisoners, and said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see men of your social
position in the dock before me, but you
have only yourselves to thank for it. Your
counsel has spoken of your laudable and
original effort to add to the gaiety of the
nation. People's idea of humour varies, and,
personally, I see nothing very funny in what
you have done. I certainly think that your
efforts might have been more worthily engaged.
Some of you are members of the
Houses of Parliament, and I really do not
know how you reconcile this club with your
position as the law-makers of the land; but
of course it may be that this is part of the
humour to which your counsel referred.
With regard to the legal aspect of the matter,
it is clear that no criminal offence has
been committed, though if Lord Lothersdale
desires, you may have to answer elsewhere
a claim for damages. You are discharged."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in vain that the ushers tried to
stop the cheers that went up as the magistrate
concluded, and as the doors of the
dock opened and the prisoners came forth.
But one little man crept away from the well
of the court, unnoticed and unrejoicing.</p>

<p>Two days later a special meeting of the
Club was held, at which it was proposed by
Colonel Altamont and seconded by the
President:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That, as according to the decision of the
Marlborough Street Police Court magistrate,
the proceedings of the Burglars' Club are
neither criminal nor humorous, and its members
run no danger of suffering personal
inconvenience, it is hereby resolved that
the Club has no connection with Sport, and
therefore no reason for existence, and that
it be disbanded forthwith."</p>

<p>A fortnight later the disbanding of the
Club was celebrated by a dinner, the guest
of the evening being Mr. Marvell. After
dessert the detective was presented with
the minute-book of the Club, which had
been kept in cipher by the Hon. Sec., who
alone had the key to it. The ex-President,
in making the presentation, expressed the
hope that Mr. Marvell would spend many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
happy and profitable years in endeavouring
to decipher it.</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell, in reply, thanked the company
for their kind reception of him, and
for the gift, which he would treasure. He
would certainly follow his Grace's suggestion
and endeavour to decipher the minutes, and
he still hoped that with this additional
evidence and a more intimate acquaintance
with the "Commentaries" of Mr. Stephen,
he would before long be enabled to return
their hospitality at His Majesty's expense.</p>

<p>Mr. Marvell's speech was received with
acclamation; but his hopes have not been
realised.</p>

<p>This is the last chronicle of the Burglars'
Club.</p>
